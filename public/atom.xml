    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think one the main topics in the Circos discussion group is how to install it, especially as it requires some specific Perl and C libraries to be in place. This short tutorial gives a step-by-step overview on how to make Circos work on OS X, but it should be similar to other *nix flavours. I just installed on my Mountain Lion box, but, again, it should be identical to previous versions of OS X.</p>

<p>My Circos is installed on</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Circos location</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>/Applications/circos-0.55/

<p>and if we try running it</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Circos trial run</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I get this error, initially</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Circos runtime error</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>So, a lot of things going wrong, we need to check what is missing and install. Circos has a couple of commands bundled in its package that help us working through the errors. Best way to run them is to cd into Circos bin directory</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Circos: checking modules</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In my case, running this script gave me a list of the required modules for Circos</p>

<p>Another script checks for the current status of each module (still from the same dir)</p>

<p>We have to address everything that failed in the test. In this case, <em>GD</em>, <em>Graphics::ColorObjects</em>, <em>Math::VecStat</em>, <em>Readonly</em> and <em>Set::IntSpan</em>. We leave GD behind for a moment and focus on the other modules (this list might vary for each Perl installation, so you might need to install more or less modules, but the commands are similar).</p>

<p>The easiest way to install module in Perl is to use <em>cpan</em>, the repository of Perl modules. It has an interactive shell that we can use, and we will see how to do that. In order to make sure our installation works we use <em>sudo</em> and call <em>cpan</em> (from any directory)</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If this is the first time you are running it, just answer <strong>yes</strong> to all config questions and you are good to go. Now we have to install the five modules required. By using the command <em>install</em>, that can be achieved</p>

<p>Now, we deal with the last module and usually the most labourious to install, <em>GD</em>. Ideally you should have all possible library support for <em>GD</em> and for this you have to install additional libraries. We are going to start with two of the most common and see if we need anything else. Usually <strong>libjpeg</strong> and <strong>libpng</strong> are required by <em>GD</em>. So, let&#8217;s download both of them</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Downloading and install libjpeg and libpng</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>That should do it for now. We will download <em>GD</em> and check if the configuration we have so far is enough. <em>GD</em>&#8217;s website is still down, but we can get the source from Bitbucket and use identical commands to install is</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Installing GD</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>At the end of the configuration run, you should see something like this</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In my case, I&#8217;m good to go. But if in your case <em>Freetype</em> and <em>Fontconfig</em> are missing, you would have to download, configure, make and install them, just like <em>libpng</em> and <em>libjpeg</em>. So now</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We are almost there. The last step is to install <em>GD</em> in Perl. Normally, if we use <em>cpan</em> to install it on OS X, it fails. So, we will have to do it by hand. We go to CPAN website and download the latest Perl&#8217;s <em>GD</em> implementation and with similar commands to above we install it.</p>

<p>you should see some output, maybe some warnings, but if you followed all the steps above the installation worked. You can run the <em>test.modules</em> script in order to check.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I wonder if non-scientists perceive us a lot that only does good things, has no ego or is only searching for the betterment of Science, with the exception of climate scientists, clearly. But sometimes, I also forget that scientists are human beings too, are one aspect of being an human is to be driven by hype. Doesn&#8217;t matter where you come from, hype is an important part of society, product development, PR departments, economy and Facebook groups.</p>

<p>When that happens, I remember Zotero. A nice, nifty little application that does some wonderful things with references. It&#8217;s open source, you can modify it, make it better, report bugs, develop with them, donate if you wish. And even better, it&#8217;s developed by real scientists, not by spoon-fed intercontinental  jet-setters backed by corporations. Zotero developers are support by grants, by people like you and me, like your parents and in-laws, and it&#8217;s an application that anyone can benefit from. Did I mention that it&#8217;s free?</p>

<p>So, when I forget about hype and scientists, I remember Zotero and I get sad with the lack of traction in Academia when compared to other similar applications. And then I remember, Zotero has no PR department, we&#8217;re its PR department and we suck on being PR. After all, we&#8217;re human beings too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Species name notation is not rocket science, does not require one to be a brain surgeon and in some ways help communication at large. Now that science, thanks to the internet, in getting more tangled into our lives (even companies and political parties have DNA), it is important to have some standard, especially in written text in order to make information exchange easier.</p>

<p>I know is easy to understand that when someone is writing homo sapiens, he or she is referring to a human of the species <em>Home sapiens</em>, or when someone writes E.Coli, it&#8217;s clear that <em>Escherichia coli</em> is the target. Most newspapers (with blogs and online presence) have writing standards and manuals; maybe including a rule that species names have to be written following the Binomial Nomenclature:</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>* Species names are usually typeset in italics; for example, _Homo sapiens_. Generally the binomial should be printed in a font different from that used in the 
normal text; for example, "Several more _Homo sapiens_ were discovered." 
* The genus name is always written with an initial capital letter.
* In current usage, the species name is never written with an initial capital.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>For example, the entire tiger species is <em>Panthera tigris</em>. Simple, eh? So, on your next seminar, C. elegans might be correctly set to <em>C. elegans</em></p>

    <id>http://zientzilaria.heroku.com/blog/2011/02/10/bioconductor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love Bioconductor, I really do. It&#8217;s a great framework, nice set of tools that do anything that you want (not that I would want to do phylogeny with it, topic for another post). But as anything scientific it has its drawbacks, and I can point three of them:</p>

<p>1 - Installing packages - we&#8217;re having problems running one package, what requires us to modify R&#8217;s compilation parameters from time to time, uninstall and reinstall things. And the most annoying thing is when you have a fresh R binary and framework, you do a basic install first and when you want another package installed if it has dependencies that are already in the system, they are downloaded and installed again.</p>

<p>2 - Website - Looking from the design and navigation point of view, it&#8217;s good. Looking at the functional side is bad. Sometimes you&#8217;re looking for the package page right away and Googles&#8217;s  first hit is the package&#8217;s page, but for an older version of R and Bioconductor. Maybe if the URL for the current release were different than the legacy ones, would be easier for the user and for indexers to get the actual relevant item. Of course, some people might be looking for legacy stuff, and if you put links for the other version in the package&#8217;s page, everything would be easier.</p>

<p>3 - Documentation - That&#8217;s not Bioconductor team&#8217;s fault, but some of the packages have very poor documentation.</p>

<p>Apart from that, I&#8217;m quite happy to have an open source powerful toolset for my data analysis. Well done.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2011/02/08/2462/">This</a> was asked by Neil, and I think I can answer it. Clearly, the publication is way more important than the actual product, sadly so.</p>

<p>The paper (or letter, comment, correspondence, whatever it is) that he points out is a complete joke, the website is a complete joke, as the most complete page on it is the CV of each member in the project. It seems that in this case there&#8217;s no peer review involved, but I bet the &#8220;authors&#8221; will dutifully used the reference in their CV.</p>

<p>I can say from experience that even with peer review, the actual product is irrelevant, at least in some of the cases. Sometimes software that I published were completely dissected by the reviewers and it was clear that they installed the application and tested. In other cases, usually the rejected ones, the software wasn&#8217;t even described in the review. It didn&#8217;t mean that we included a good documentation for the end-user, it didn&#8217;t mean that we worked on portability or an efficient code.</p>

<p>Also from experience, I can tell many stories of published software (by others) that is broken, doesn&#8217;t compile, has no documentation and fails to deliver what is supposed to be delivered.</p>

<p>Sometime to publish software, the authors&#8217; names are the only thing that matters.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A perfect <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2005685">comment</a> on Hackernews, in response to this <a href="http://www.webiphany.com/2010/12/14/is-brazil-finally-ready-to-fulfill-on-its-destiny-as-the-country-of-the-future/">article</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>No, it&#8217;s not. Most of my extended family is in Brazil so my wife and I decided to work remote from Brazil for a couple months this fall. It&#8217;s hard to really understand how crippling the culture of bureaucracy and corruption is until you experience it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Internet. $200/mo USD for a theoretical 1MB connection. That&#8217;s assuming the power stays on. Lots of people use the internet (mostly at cafes) but it&#8217;s only for games and social networking &#8211; nobody thinks of it as legitimate way to make money.</p>

<p>Crime. In many parts of Sao Paulo and Rio people don&#8217;t even stop at stoplights because the risk of getting shot and carjacked is too real.</p>

<p>Education. Completely broken. Cheating is so rampant most teachers don&#8217;t even try to prevent it from happening. That&#8217;s at the private schools where my cousins have attended&#8211; public schools are apparently far worse.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs. Most people literally don&#8217;t even have a mental category for this. At best they make vague negative associations about you being a &#8220;capitalist.&#8221; The dream job is either working for the government or getting an engineering position at some multi-national corporation.</p>

<p>All of this is unfortunate because the Brazilian people are really delightful and quite creative. My wife is a designer and she says some of the best design is coming out of Brazil right now. Unfortunately corruption and regulation has completely driven out the spirit of innovation and that is unlikely to change anytime soon.</p>

<p>Nailed it.</p>

    <id>http://zientzilaria.heroku.com/blog/2010/12/07/youre-quite-wrong-nasa</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/12/06/arsenic-microbe-dna-nasa-wolfe-simon.html?ref=rss#ixzz17P6UT100">slammed</a> Rosie Redfield&#8217;s assessment (or review) on the <em>new</em> form of life that was <em>found</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown was asked about public criticisms of the paper in the blogosphere, he noted that the article was peer-reviewed and published in one of the most prestigious scientific journals. He added that Wolfe-Simon will not be responding to individual criticisms, as the agency doesn&#8217;t feel it is appropriate to debate the science using the media and bloggers. Instead, it believes that should be done in scientific publications.</p></blockquote>

<p>To say the least, it&#8217;s hypocritical to call a press-release to tout about your <em>new discovery</em> and then say that the debate shouldn&#8217;t be in the media. Peer review is wrong, bad and broken, and without a 180 degree fast turn it will die a slow death, being surpassed by what NASA calls &#8220;the media&#8221;. Being published on Science is not a badge of quality; nowadays it&#8217;s a badge of connections (most of the time), a badge of who do you know and who knows you. The worst papers I read in my life were published in Science and Nature, and they were not high impact papers either to the public or the field.</p>

<p>If NASA didn&#8217;t want to bring the discussion to the public realm, let Science (not the journal) take its due course and correct the paper. Maybe Science (the journal) is losing ground and relevance to Nature, maybe there were no peer-review of this paper, who knows, and they needed the exposure (NASA is losing budget too). But if it&#8217;s a bad paper and there&#8217;s no PR, scientists will try, check, re-analyse data, write more papers about the issue and then, maybe in five, ten years, we will have a final answer. &#8220;The media&#8221; always existed: scientists wrote letters when there were no emails. There were always been conferences, meetings, where things were discussed, checked and re-checked. Were there mistakes? Obviously, but time took its course, and things were slower and sometimes quite wrong, sometimes really right.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the problem of the Generation Mendeley®: they want things now, in this exact minute. There&#8217;s always a final and definite instantaneous answer. They have the social sites on their side, but don&#8217;t accept when the same hand that feeds them, bites them. Software with major bugs is the next saviour of citation. <em>New life form</em> is proof that aliens are out there. And I will have sushi for lunch. PR, PR, PR, always the now, the now, this exact second. No wonder that so many people come to Science now in order to &#8220;cure cancer ASAP&#8221;.</p>

<p>BTW, without googling it, what were the names of the cold fusion guys?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m quite late jumping on the bandwagon, but after reading <a href="http://rrresearch.blogspot.com/2010/12/arsenic-associated-bacteria-nasas.html">this</a> and visiting <a href="http://www.ironlisa.com/">this site</a>, both related to the new &#8220;form&#8221; of life found recently, I can only say a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I don&#8217;t know if young scientists (this included my generation and me) need to do this kind of PR to achieve something in their careers</p></li>
<li><p>Based on the quality, and lack of, of the paper, as assessed by Rosie Redefield, it&#8217;s very sorry that Science and scientists accept this kind of publication in their journals. For one, this only reinforces my feeling that most of the things that are published on Nature and Science are just things that will sell more paper, and reinforces my will to not read most of the papers from these journals</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I would expect in the coming years to meet students that will fall in both categories: ones crazy for PR and with a website full of pictures showing how connected they are, others will read a paper and like Rosie Redfield will have the necessary intelligence to actually read the Science behind the PR. The latter will be the ones I will admire and will teach and learn from. The ones from Generation Mendeley will be just an empty shell, maybe with a good job.</p>

    <id>http://zientzilaria.heroku.com/blog/2010/12/01/why-i-left-biostar-but-i-still-like-stackoverflow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About eight months ago I started using Biostar as I saw it as a great
opportunity to exchange some ideas, concepts, tips in biology and
bioinformatics. I even mentioned the website in this space, trying to
bring more people to the mix; at the time the community wasn&#8217;t big
enough, and some days went by without any question being posted. But a
couple of months ago my interest started to go down the drain. I don&#8217;t
know if it was the constant next-generation sequencing barrage of
questions every day, if it was the infantile blog/twitter posts from
members competing for points or maybe the lack of votes for some answers
that I posted (that&#8217;s selfish on my part, I admit). But at some point it
seemed that the website turned into a competition of CVs or knowledge,
very different from what I could see in different Stackoverflow
spin-offs or in the main site. I guess the turning-point, or the moment
I realized that the scientific community (at least in bioinformatics and
related fields) will never the be the same as the programming and
statistical ones, was the time I gave an answer that had less votes that
the one saying &#8220;it&#8217;s not possible&#8221;. Maybe the problem is myself, I don&#8217;t
like cliques, don&#8217;t mind helping people for nothing, don&#8217;t care about
reputation. I didn&#8217;tt care about how many points I had, and used the
down-vote to actually vote down answers that I didn&#8217;t see as pertinent
(if you never used those sites, every down-vote removes one point from
your score). I still think that Biostar is a great idea, and I wish it
becomes a great resource for all the bio fields. Maybe if the community
gets big enough, maybe if don&#8217;t see the same group of people that you
see every where else it might become a better place to hang-out online.
