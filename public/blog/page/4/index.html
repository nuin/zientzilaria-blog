<p>Let&#8217;s show our community power and inundate  Twitter, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=153928757951484">Facebook</a> (I created a group on Facebook), Friendfeed and all social network sites with requests for making Mendeley Open Source!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of course it makes sense. For better or worse, Mendeley has a tight following in the among the open-sciencers and associated hipsters, that would pay, donate and help keep the company afloat (see Reddit, even though they were bought by the nasty Conde). Also, going open-source would be a gutsy move, a heck of a PR turn around. It would silence its critics (me included) and it will use the momentum to improve their products and the crappy desktop app.</p>

<p>Imagine the scenario where hundreds of clever people will be buried in Mendeley&#8217;s code trying to tweak it and make it better, faster and more reliable. These are very clever people and they work usually for nothing, maybe a like on Friendfeed or an invitation to the next Science Online meeting (let&#8217;s make it in some resort location). Mendeley will also have the opportunity to show their corporate clients that they have the community behind them and the community will go wherever Mendeley will go. It&#8217;s a win-win, there&#8217;s nothing to lose. And all I&#8217;m reading and feeding from my sources suggest that&#8217;s the differential in Mendeley&#8217;s history. They have the opportunity to put their app where their mouths are.</p>

<p><strong>What side of History are you on, Mendeley?</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After extensively researching some material online, analysing many blog posts and statements made by people linked to Mendeley, checking my sources, I reached the conclusion that soon Mendeley is going to be open source. They already use a good chunk of <a href="http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/6174/mendeley/">Zotero&#8217;s codebase</a> and IMHO their only move would be to open their system, so it can be vastly improved.</p>

<p>Also, it does not make a sense for a company that in every level of management is publicly advocating for Open Science, Open Data, etc to keep their code closed. By opening their code, which for once I commend Mendeley&#8217;s team for deciding to do that, they will benefit from the same system they are now feeding from and will lead by example in this new Scientific movement. After all, what side of History are they on?</p>

<p>I think the API, even handicapped and quickly put together with so many problem, was the initial step towards a full open source adventure for them. I think it&#8217;s a bold move, but again, for the first time Mendeley&#8217;s team made a perfect decision, that will put the company shoulder-to-shoulder to other scientific and software innovators. When they will announce this - I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;m guessing in a couple of months - it will be a major breakthrough to the Open-movement, and the leadership-by-example will create an unstoppable momentum for all the open-sciencers.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t read here often, but I applaud Mendeley for their boldness, openness and will to lead the New Science, from the right side of History.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know if this is just a personal perspective or if it is global. To be honest, I haven&#8217;t checked, haven&#8217;t googled about it. But there are many examples of software (paid or not) that start as a very nice option to do some type of task and in the end become a bloody nuisance. The first version is wonderful, just works, installs perfectly and gives enough functionality, nothing more, nothing less, for said task. Then this little application grows and grows, the company grows with it, maybe their codebase gets too crowded, maybe they hire a CEO, maybe new programmers.</p>

<p>And that little application becomes a bloody nuisance. The latest version wants to install a shady add-bar to your Explore/Firefox, maybe wants you to update it every hour. That little application has some many features now that the task it was suited for in the beginning, is just an afterthought now.</p>

<p>One example that comes to mind are the anti-virus applications. Free like AVG, paid as McAfee, they grew and grew and some of them cannot be uninstalled without a four-page long guide, or install so many add-ons that your computer looks like a mirror of Download.com (another example of bloated app/site).</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know, again, if this is just a personal perspective, don&#8217;t know blog posts about it. But in the end, whenever something grows without control, or mismanaged control, be an application, site or company, there will be some type of <em>evil</em> component in whatever they provide. Of course, there are exceptions, but that&#8217;s what every rule asks for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that they dominate every single niche of scientific PR-bull, have pitbulls threatening people not to publish some negative comments about them, are trying to use free representative at universities, they also want to become the beacon of Open Science, open-whatever:</p>

<blockquote><p>We came to the conclusion that technology is finally at a point that if we don’t use it now, then we are holding back the progress of science. And what exactly are we to use technology on? Open science/data/access.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, use Mendeley. More and more, and then Science will be open.</p>

<blockquote><p>For the past three centuries those two requirements could not be satisfied due to a lack of technology, but why are we not fulfilling them now? We have the tech (i.e. Internet), so something else is going on. It is easy to place the blame on publishers trying to protect business models, but that would be misplaced judgment. The business models for Open Access and Open Data are there, trust me (or go ask PLoS). Publishers are already experimenting with the models, but they are waiting for something before going full force. They are waiting for us, the researchers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thank you, Internet (whoever you are). Without you Science wouldn&#8217;t reach the point it is now. Wait, what? Yes, the business models are there, trust him, or just ask PLoS for all the money they are charging, and when you meet someone that is not blessed with technology (==money) and cannot publish on open access (they publish for free, but you have to wait), you can tell them the story of a place where tehcnology (==money) blesses everyone and all data flows free and papers are stored (for a price) on Mendeley&#8217;s servers.</p>

<blockquote><p>Each time we hold back data or publish research that isn’t immediately open to all, we have chosen to be on the wrong side of history</p></blockquote>

<p>And that&#8217;s your fault to be on the wrong side of history and good people. You are evil and your wife, husband, kids need to eat, but you don&#8217;t have tenure and you hide your data; that&#8217;s all you want: to hide your data and not show to anyone, because your contract is expiring in a couple of months and if you publish in a good journal they might renew it. Cut the chains that bind you to the oppressors, come to the right side, and store your references and papers (limited quantity) on Mendeley&#8217;s servers.</p>

<blockquote><p>We could wait for policy changes from the top, but that is neither a timely, nor guaranteed solution</p></blockquote>

<p>Post-docs and graduate students of the world unite, non-ternured staff too. Next time your boss or supervisor asks you to not disclose some data, tell them to go to hell, resign and go work for some Open Science advocate, or Mendeley (I heard they have quite good internships there)</p>

<blockquote><p>Platforms such as Mendeley can have a hand in meeting both the first and second conditions. Mendeley is more than just a reference manager, it is also a system that aggregates the metadata of millions of documents and provides authors the opportunity to promote their works. We are now taking this one step further having created the beginnings of an author analytics platform.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s no free lunch out there. All that revolution-in-the-academics yada yada yada to come to the conclusion that Mendeley will solve everything, because it&#8217;s more than just a reference manager. It aggregates data and metadata (for a price) and gives me, you, the guy-next-door to promote works. Just like a journal. But it also gives you analytics: you will know how many bots accessed your paper or Mendeley farms were trained to add your papers, so it inflates the analytics and you get tenure because of that. Mendeley will do that for a price too, don&#8217;t you think? I don&#8217;t trust people that plays with censorship.</p>

<blockquote><p>A publication snapshot is nothing earth shattering and it has a long way to grow. It has many valid concerns, such as gaming that must be accounted for. Fundamentally though, this is not just another metric to base the next grant or tenure selection upon, although eventually it could/should be used that way. To the point, this is about being on the right side of history in promoting Open Science.</p></blockquote>

<p>That explains a lot. It shouldn&#8217;t be used, but it might. Eventually. But you will be on the right side. It gets to a point that I need a compass, or for the technology blessed, a GPS.</p>

<p>But it ends on a high note</p>

<blockquote><p>Those researchers who openly and quickly publish research or data for download will be rewarded.* Those who do not will adapt or risk falling into obscurity. As we wait for policy changes to be enacted by the top, we must act at the bottom to encourage a behavioral change in how we share our knowledge. I think we owe that to the students, hipsters, and citizens in coffee shops everywhere.</p></blockquote>

<p>I never understood why sharing the knowledge means opening all your data. Why paper access metrics should be used to measure something real. It&#8217;s nice to have a highly accessed paper on BMC, but you know that some of the hits came from you or maybe colleagues. And why the changes have to come from below? If I don&#8217;t have tenure, or I&#8217;m only a student I can try changing, but the final word always comes from who signs the check that feeds your family.</p>

<blockquote><p>Which side of history will you be on?</p></blockquote>

<p>I never understood why I should pick a side, or why someone in a company (with thugs) should challenge me to pick a side. I don&#8217;t know which side I&#8217;m on, I know History is define by powerful people, even though the burden and the work is carried by the silent millions. The only thing I could say about sides, is that I want to be on Mendeley&#8217;s opposite one, even if it becomes the standard for anything. I don&#8217;t side with censorship, hype and hot air.</p>

<blockquote><p>*Exactly how that is rewarded through our search and recommendation engines has yet to be implemented, as we need to balance relevance as much as reputation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Give me the source code of Mendeley and I will tell you how to implement. After all, it&#8217;s easy to be open with someone else&#8217;s stuff. Also, I&#8217;m looking forward to get Jason&#8217;s email with a link to all the projects he&#8217;s working on at the moment and all the data he ever generated. History is better set by example.</p>

<p><em>PS: Comments from anyone financially involved with Mendeley, especially the thugs, will be blocked.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately, I realized that the Web&#8217;s Future (or The Future of the Web) is not Facebook. No, it doesn&#8217;t matter that all your friends (enemies) are there, doesn&#8217;t matter that all companies are moving to Facebook-based pages, that everything you like is there, and your mum is sending you friendship requests.</p>

<p>No, the web&#8217;s future (or The Future of the Web) is much larger than Facebook. The future of the web is an application that allows you to play in the financial market, find conferences and even plot a map with them, can analyse the stars, check browser histories, do science and screw the life of your worst enemies with a complex syntax and obscure data typing. I might have forgotten that this application saved lives in Haiti, intends to bring peace to the Middle East (via a very elaborate graph) and even solve the Tea Party issue in US (via a very elaborate graph). The future of the web (or the web&#8217;s future) is the one and only <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>. R can do everything and a little bit more.</p>

<p>But what R cannot do is find you a girlfriend. Or at least I haven&#8217;t read about. Until then, I&#8217;m a skeptic.</p>

<blockquote><p>He seems almost proud of his own narcissism. As if people were just waiting with bated breath for him to grace his audience with another tit-for-tat in this petty feud. Oh what an inconvenience it is for him to have to update his own douchey blog.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tried to become a Mendeley University Advisor, whatever it is. It&#8217;s the old saying &#8220;I&#8217;m in the System to destroy it from within&#8221;. Understandably, I didn&#8217;t get the gig. But what surprised me is the <em>personal</em> touch in the their message:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thank you for your interest in becoming a Mendeley University Advisor!</p></blockquote>

<p>We have now received hundreds of applications from around the globe representing a wide range of academic disciplines. The sheer amount of applicants has been overwhelming and we’re currently filled to capacity. Over the next few months, we will further expand the Advisor program, at which point we would love to have you join us! You don’t need to do anything to follow up, we’ve added you to the waitlist and will be in touch as space becomes available. Thanks again for your interest and please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or comments.</p>

<p>So, I guess Mendeley, apart from huge PR campaign, acts like they&#8217;re a huge company when they need to send automatic emails to the thousands of applicants to this desirable position. But, yet they forget to add the sucker&#8217;s name to the email.</p>

<p>I think I will have a Pepsi.</p>
