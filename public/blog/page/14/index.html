<p>Some time ago there was a meme about science blogging and one of the questions were &#8220;why do you blog&#8221;. Well, I do it because of the &#8221;<a href="http://www.nadasurf.com/">Nada Surf</a> effect&#8221;. You don&#8217;t know the &#8220;Nada Surf effect&#8221;? Pity you weren&#8217;t in Washington, DC 2001.</p>

<p>In March or April of 2001, Nada Surf played a concert there. It was a small bar on 14th Street W, close to the more famous Black Cat. It was a spring night, I was with a couple of Dutch friends that had told me about the concert, if I&#8217;m not wrong, a couple of days before. It was also mid-week, so you wouldn&#8217;t expect big crowds in most concerts. We left ISH around 7 pm, with spare time for the 9 pm concert. We didn&#8217;t know the venue, we got there and it was empty, just a couple of souls at the bar. We sat and for about an hour we were pondering if we were in the right place, until a guy came and asked if we were staying for the concert. We said yes, paid th US$ 7.50 of the admittance and sipped our beers waiting for the opening act. Soon after we paid, a van parked outside and some guys started bringing music equipment inside. At that time there must have been around 20 people there. The van guys set the instruments, wasted 5 minutes soundchecking, and started. IT was Ashtray Babyhead.</p>

<p>They played for 40 minutes and as fast as they arrived they left. Another van parked outside and this time Nada Surf members started unloading and setting up the stage. Now roadies. OK, maybe one guy helped, but I&#8217;m getting old and the memory sometimes falters. At that point in time, almost 9 pm, the number of brave souls was at 50. They played as they were playing for 50.000 people in Wembley. Nice set, great songs, unforgettable night. After the show, they sold CDs at the usual after-show gathering, we talked about New York, Brazil and feijoada.</p>

<p>And why do I call it the &#8220;Nada Surf effect&#8221;? A band that used to play for thousands of people in festivals and stadiums, had a number one video on MTV (Popular), played in a midweek night in a small bar in Washington, DC as it was the band farewell. Every fan that night felt that they were the most important one, maybe even the only one.</p>

<p>And this type of example is the one that brings me to write this, and to write Beginning Python for Bioinformatics. Especially the latter (as I spend too much time here, writing about non-important stuff). If I can make one person have an idea, one person there to use Python, or least to learn something extra in their lives, I&#8217;m happy. I don&#8217;t care if I have a huge audience or if I&#8217;m famous. I care for the undergrad that is starting today, the high school kid that is hacking at night, or the Java coder that is looking for some better language (Ok, not really, but I couldn&#8217;t resist). And this is one of the things that I learned in Science, always give back and don&#8217;t expect anything in return. Just add to the pile of knowledge.</p>

<p>So, my advice for the three people that read this site is: let Nada Surf in!</p>

<p>&#8220;Owners of capital will stimulate working class to buy more and more of expensive goods, houses and technology, pushing them to take more and more expensive credits, until their debt becomes unbearable.
The unpaid debt will lead to bankruptcy of banks, which will have to be nationalized, and State will have to take the road which will eventually lead to communism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nope. Karl. Marx,</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, <a href="http://mndoci.com">Deepak</a>&#8217;s latest posts lacked a little bit of whatever his posts had in the past. First he comes with the original idea that <a href="http://mndoci.com/blog/2009/01/31/funding-science-its-important/">funding science is important</a>. Then he claims that if you don&#8217;t want to stay in academia, you should <a href="http://mndoci.com/blog/2009/02/02/join-a-startup/">join a startup</a> or start one.</p>

<p>I agree with both his posts. But this is not what I want from Deepak, I want more and these don&#8217;t deliver. It&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m (or half of me) in academia that I think science funding is important. Science funding is important in any aspect of life, and it&#8217;ll always be. That&#8217;s what drives the economy of a country, innovation, and innovation comes from science, either in academia or in industry. But, I&#8217;m not here to write about funding. I want to write about joining a startup, and I have two stories to tell.</p>

<p>The first one is personal the second not so much. Early in 2004 I decided to look for a job in a company. I was a little bit frustrated with my scientific results and I might have realized at the time that academic life was not for me. I tried searching companies in Canada and Europe, and didn&#8217;t have much luck in either place. But a couple of months after I started searching, I found a nice startup in Europe with a fancy website (for the time) and what looked like a promising future. At least from what I saw on the website, they had some money from the government of such country to use on bioinformatics research. I contacted the person responsible for the company and had a great reception, and we exchanged a good number of emails for more than an year, trying to find ways to find moeny so I can spend some time at the company and see if we connected. I had at the time an impression that company, even though being only a small startup, was solid and they were planning for a bright future. Then later in 2005 I found the opportunity to meet with the owner of the company. There was a conference in Europe and I was awarded a travel grant, which would cover 1/3 of the costs of going there. Everything was set with the person and we were to meet at the conference.</p>

<p>When I got there, I searched and searched for the person. Then I remembered that a couple of months before he would be doing some kind of internship at one of the best European&#8217;s bioinformatics institutes. I asked around and learned that he was a lab X at such institute and he wouldn&#8217;t come to the conference due to some &#8220;last minute problems&#8221;. OK, I thought, wait and see. I wrote a polite email when I got back, and ceased any type of correspondence with such person. Early in 2006, I learned that he closed the company and accepted a position in another institute. And much later he found a position in another company.</p>

<p>Lessons? Yes, at least one, or maybe many. Joining a startup is risky, and will give you less stability than joining a big company, like Amazon. Don&#8217;t trust everyone in a startup (as you shouldn&#8217;t trust everyone in a  big company) even if they have governmental funding. Joining a startup will give more intellectual flexibility, that&#8217;s a a give, but you have to calculate if that&#8217;s a pro or a con. As anything in life there&#8217;s two sides (or multiple), and this has to be a well thought decision, to avoid being lured by promises and frustrated with no delivery.</p>

<p>The other story comes from a lecture I watched a couple of years ago. The lab I was working at the time moved to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaRS_Discovery_District">MaRS</a> complex in downtown Toronto. MaRS is also an incubator and to foster new entrepreneurship, and one of the activities is an 101 seminar series. One of the seminars was what were the difficulties oof creating a startup in clinical/medical research. I remember the slides of this woman and each company she had created and sold after a couple of years. She gave the name of at least eight companies there had been absorbed by large companies, which were then absorbed by even larger companies. And she talked about this for more than an hour. Lesson? You can get very lucky if the startup you&#8217;re in gets bought by a larger company. But remember, large companies might not be interested in you, or you might not be long enough in the startup to receive any dividends of the incorporation. As in the previous story, be careful and check everything before accepting anything.</p>

<p>So, these were my stories with startups. A final lesson: if advice were good, people would sell it, not publish for free on the internet. Use the two cents I gave you the best you can.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As mentioned in the previous post, Robin Stocker kindly provided a git
patch with the required changes to all scripts stored on the repository
to be compliant with the PEP 8. The changes were mainly regarding
variable/object names, but they were important as make the code
available here more Pythonic following the rules of the Benevolent
Dictator for Life. I would like to thank Robin for spending his time
doing this. Much appreciated. Now, just a quick git tutorial on how to
apply patches: git apply __patch_file__ git commit -a -m &#8220;patch
applied&#8221; git push That&#8217;s it. Apply, commit, push and you&#8217;re done. The
repository is already updated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, we&#8217;re back! And to the old-new story of why the Open Science movement will fail, at least for now. I was planning to post something on a different note, but a <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/08fefccf-a78a-ec1b-bc25-a77d07dca656/A-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the/">recent discussion thread</a> on FriendFeed called me to post about it.</p>

<p>This thread was started by a <a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2009/01/21/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-forum/">blog entry</a> the poster-boy of the Open Science/Research/Buzz-Word-of-the-moment Movement, <a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/User:Cameron_Neylon">Cameron Neylon</a>.</p>

<p>As most of the &#8220;literature&#8221; you find in his blog, very well written, he uses a metaphor of some mundane human social behaviour/activity trying to captivate the reader and bring him to his &#8220;open&#8221; universe. Sometimes it&#8217;s related to a train commute, sometimes a music or a scientific article. When the the reader is inside his web, BANG! comes the open science mantra, that we have to be open, that we have to prevent the existence of a walled-garden of discussions, that we have to open everyuthing, make it more accessible, etc. At this point, you, the reader, are willing to sell your house or your first born and donate all the money to the Open Science/Research/Buzz-Word-of-the-moment and do whatever he proposes to open more Science and the discussion around science topics.</p>

<p>But, oops!, there&#8217;s a problem, and a big one: there is no proposition, no alternative on how we put down the so-called walled-garden of FriendFeed-limited discussions. What more openness does he need? What is the alternative of posting a comment to his blog, which is somewhat mirrored on FriendFeed? One just need and email and a password to join the discussion on FF, basically the same number of clicks to post a comment on his blog. Both services are indexed in Google, and saved somewhere for posterity. There are some aspects that might prevent someone of participating in the discussion, like not wanting to or not knowing the services.</p>

<p>This line of thinking, where one person uses more than two paragraphs to show how every one else is wrong, but the ingroup, and at the same time no concrete (even imaginary) alternative is proposed resembles the same tactics used by the hard-core cladists. For them, ClustalW is a product of the devil, Maximum Likelihood should not be taught in universities and Apple is the cult of the beast. In the end the hard-core cladists were shunned in a corner and had their research (or at least part of it) tagged with cult status, at least in the scientific circle I exist. (If you are a soft-core cladist, I embrace you).</p>

<p>In one way or another that&#8217;s what will happen to the Open Science/Research/Buzz-Word-of-the-moment Movement, if they keep on producing the same shallow rhetoric and proposing the same weightless, empty, nonexistent alternatives. Serious people that don&#8217;t know about their proposition, one day will notice that in the end they don&#8217;t do nothing at all, much less propose anything that can minimally change the future of scientific research.</p>

<p>And before you beat me and say that I also don&#8217;t propose anything different, you&#8217;re definitely right. But I never announced any intention on doing so, I&#8217;m just a scientist with an opinion. And opinions in our era are free.</p>

<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/33b8dcff-a566-9cce-105f-c100afc240fe/Why-Open-Science-Research-won-t-work-at-least-for/">Follow the discussion on FF</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my humble opinion (of sorts!) every band, musical group, singer, bad or good, mediocre or excellent have, in one way or another, produced at least one masterpiece (yes, I like commas). This song can be extremely good or just ordinary. If it&#8217;s extremely good it surpasses or rivals other compositions of identical level, if it&#8217;s ordinary, it might be the one and only good (in terms) song that that group created.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to the 17th edition of the Cancer Research Blog Carnival. This is my first time hosting it and it has been a fun time reading the submissions and learning a little bit what are the new things in cancer research. The subject hasn&#8217;t been present in my blog even though I have close contact with oncologists and cancer researchers. For those that usually stop by, the Cancer Research Blog Carnival is a monthly collection of cancer-related blogging. Personally, I don&#8217;t work directly with Cancer but I have done work that was used in cancer research applications.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s start the new year and check what has been submitted. Enjoy!</p>

<p>First we have a submission from Walter Jessen who presents <a href="http://www.highlighthealth.com/diseases-and-conditions/gene-expression-can-predict-the-survival-of-lymphoma-patients/">Gene Expression Can Predict the Survival of Lymphoma Patients</a> posted at <a href="http://www.highlighthealth.com">Highlight HEALTH</a>. The study deals with the use of DNA microarrays in order to determine expression profiles of genes that influence chemotherapy treatments of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Such profiles can help define the ideal treatment and as Walter points out in the prognosis of the malignancy.</p>

<blockquote><p>This study exemplifies how gene expression can be used as a clinical prognostic factor. Indeed, such studies herald the future of genomic medicine. Specifically for DLBCL, this study suggests that only a subgroup of patients whose tumors are characterized by high relative expression of the stromal-2 signature may benefit from drugs that inhibit angiogenesis.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second link comes from Orna Ross that brings us <a href="http://www.ornaross.com/living-with-cancer/2008/11/good-things-ive-gained-from-having-cancer-2/">Good Things I&#8217;ve Gained from Having Cancer #2</a> posted at <a href="http://www.ornaross.com">Orna Ross</a>. Everyone that has had cancer or have a relative with cancer can relate to the sentiments that Orna writes in her post. Just find the bigger importance to what is really important.</p>

<blockquote><p>I still love plans and to-dos but cancer has heightened my awareness of what I’ve always known.  That everything dies and that, meantime, this is it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Miracle cures? is what Kat Arney presents <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2008/12/03/cancer-cured-for-good-gc-maf-and-the-miracle-cure/">&#8220;Cancer cured for good?&#8221; – Gc-MAF and the miracle cure</a> posted at <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org">Cancer Research UK - Science Update</a>. As Kat writes, I really thought that it was too good to be true from the start. The original study reviewed in the post states that injections of Gc <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage_activating_factor">macrophage activating factor</a> (Gc-MAF), what theoretically can induce macrophages to fight cancer. And why don&#8217;t macrophages fighter cancer to begin with? Because Gc-MAF is not naturally produced by the body when some types of tumours are present, as they release the Nagalase (alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase) enzyme.</p>

<blockquote><p>Our conclusioon - it&#8217;s interesting work, but certainly not the &#8220;100% cure&#8221; that is being promoted in some quarters. This post has got a lot of traffic - people are obviously searching for it - but we haven&#8217;t found a considered scientific analysis of the work anywhere else on the web. It&#8217;s also prompted a bit of debate, as you might expect.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our fourth submission of the month is brought by Kevin Beck: <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/the_spontaneous_regression_of_breast_can.php">The spontaneous regression of breast cancer?</a> posted at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/">Respectful Insolence</a>. It&#8217;s a long post, that reviews some interesting findings on breast cancer that may spontaneously regress or increased significantly after a mammography. As any complex disease with many variables involved it&#8217;s quite hard to understand which variables are actually working on keeping the disease alive or killing it. Also it&#8217;s difficult to know how would be the progression of the different tumours and which ones would progress and which ones will regress.</p>

<blockquote><p>Moreover, it is quite possible that a significant proportion of breast cancers detected by mammography (although, I hasten to add, not cancers detected as palpable masses) may indeed regress. The problem is that we do not yet know enough to identify which tumors will progress and which may not.</p></blockquote>

<p>Next, we have a submission from Orac presenting <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bushwells/2008/12/prozac_the_anticancer_drug.php">Dr. Joan Bushwell&#8217;s Chimpanzee Refuge : Prozac, the anti-cancer drug?</a> posted at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bushwells/">Dr. Joan Bushwell&#8217;s Chimpanzee Refuge</a>. This post deals with the prescription of antidepressant drugs to cancer patients. It has been discovered that Prozac can increase the effectiveness of doxorubicin, an anti-cancer agent.</p>

<blockquote><p>In animal models, a mild doxorubicin-fluoxetine treatment combination slowed down tumor progression significantly. These results suggest that pairing Prozac with chemotherapeutic drugs to curb drug resistance warrants further clinical study, says Dr. Peer.</p></blockquote>

<p>Moving on, Alexey Bersenev presents <a href="http://hematopoiesis.info/2008/12/05/cancer-stem-cells-how-mouse-model-can-change-the-concept/">Cancer stem cells - how mouse model can change the concept</a> posted at <a href="http://hematopoiesis.info">Hematopoiesis</a>. This post shows a short review of what has been published and discovered about Cancer Stem Cells and their models for different tumour types. So, are these models useful for all types of cancer or is it a more complex problem? Alexey also brings us <a href="http://hematopoiesis.info/2008/12/28/validity-of-the-cancer-stem-cell-concept-under-discussion/">Validity of the cancer stem cell concept under discussion</a> posted at <a href="http://hematopoiesis.info">Hematopoiesis</a>. Continuing on the cancer stem cell theme, this post gets different opinions and comments of researchers of this controversial topic. It&#8217;s a hot topic and surely getting a lot of steam recently with new research findings and papers published.</p>

<blockquote><p>This week, everyone is talking about cancer stem cells (CSC), everywhere on the web. I wrote about this a half year ago and it has been finally materialized in the paper. Basically the main reason for a new boom is a Nature report from Sean Morrison’s lab which shows that cancer stem cell concept doesn’t apply for human melanoma.</p></blockquote>

<p>Last, but not least, Kamel presents <a href="http://bayblab.blogspot.com/2008/12/early-detection-and-cancer-survival.html">Bayblab: Early Detection and Cancer Survival</a> posted at <a href="http://bayblab.blogspot.com/">Bayblab</a>. This entry ponders about a recent Wired magazine article about cancer detection and survival. Is a take on the mainstream media and the (mis)conceptions of some cancer related topics. Should we ban cancer treatment and focus on cancer detection?</p>

<blockquote><p>The article argues, based on cancer survival statistics, that &#8220;scientists should stop trying to cure cancer and start focusing on finding it early.&#8221; The author notes that in the case of ovarian cancer, for example, discovery at stage I or II the 10-year survival rate is almost 90%, while the survival if diagnosis occurs later - at stage III or IV - drops dramatically to 20%.</p></blockquote>

<p>And this is the carnival for the first month of the new year. I would like to thank Walter and the guys at Bayblab (you should contact them at bayblab[at]gmail[dot]com if you want to host) for the opportunity and I hope to host the carnival later in the year.</p>

<p>A last minute announcement from Walter Jessen regarding the new subscription options for the carnival. The Cancer Research Blog Carnival now has subscription options; you can follow by <a href="feed://feedproxy.google.com/CancerResearchBlogCarnival">email or RSS feed</a>. An aggregated feed of credible, rotating health and medicine blog carnivals is also <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/HealthAndMedicineBlogCarnivals">available</a>.</p>

<p>Happy New Year everyone!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been putting my Vista machine to sleep (I know wrong verb tense, but it&#8217;s being put to sleep slowly), so I&#8217;m transferring some files from it to my main machine at the moment, and some of these files were fonts that work in either system. I had about 1000 free fonts and decided to put install them on my iMac. Of course, something broke and Thunderbird and iTunes started to display text in a cuneiform (or cuneiform-ish) font. So, as a good computer guy I have my system backed up my TimeMachine and I restored the</p>

<p>/Library/Font</p>

<p>directory just in case a font was installed over some system font. I used a backup copy of the dir a couple of months old, rebooted the system and voilà! the cuneiform font was still there. Then, I decided to dig deeper, and I searched for how to restore the fonts on Leopard. The less aggressive way I found was to reinstall it. Thanks but no thanks, I thought. Then I decided to dig even deeper (it was getting hot) and I decided to search for the culprit fonts. It wasn&#8217;t easy among thousands of fonts, so I called spotlight to help me, and searched initially for anything called &#8220;fonts&#8221; and to my surprise there are two Fonts directories</p>

<p>/Library/Fonts
/>/Library/Fonts</p>

<p>Checking both, I discovered that the new installed fonts were in the latter and it was also taking precedence over the main system dir. Nice, this makes things even easier, as I just need to remove the fonts from //Library/Fonts and problem solved. And it was!</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I may be dumb (most of the cases you are right) and I also might no read manuals and not have a large knowledge of systems, so if you are the I&#8217;m-always-right-and-know-everything-guy from the interwebs, good for you and you shouldn&#8217;t be reading this anyway. It worked for me so you mileage may vary.Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/fonts">fonts</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/os%20x">os x</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/restoring%20system">restoring system</a></p>
