  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of days ago I posted on my Python/Bioinformatics an entry called &#8217;<a href="http://python.genedrift.org/2010/04/08/the-sickest-python-code-ive-ever-created-1/">The &#8220;sickest&#8221; Python code I&#8217;ve ever created</a>&#8217;. It&#8217;s a code that does some file management for proteomics data, with a different set of inputs each time you run it.</p>

<p>The &#8220;sickest&#8221; part of the title is that it was a small challenge to me. I&#8217;ve been away of actual hard-core coding for quite sometime, and you lose some of the gist of the thing with time. Mostly, nowadays, I make simple scripts that don&#8217;t require any kind of advanced skills (in any language) and I don&#8217;t worry that much of releasing code or about ultra fast performance. I knew from the time I posted that a lot of people would jump and help and teach me, as I was aware it wasn&#8217;t the most elegant code out there, not even the most Pythonic one too. What also helped me is that my Python/Bioinformatics blog is indexed on Planet Python, and the audience is far more hard-core Python that I ever dreamed of getting by myself alone.</p>

<p>But the real deal is that I believe it would be much more difficult for me to get some positive feedback or even an answer if I had posted bits of my code on a online forum or community or list. Every time I used one of these methods, I either got no answer, or got schooled for not posting in the right format or somebody replied that no one knew how to do it. There&#8217;s the real deal of blogging, and the value is even higher if your audience knows more than you do. I appreciate every comment I got on that post and on others too, I learned things that I wasn&#8217;t able to learn from computer books and online tutorials (yes, I searched sometimes before reading the comments, and sometimes after).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think it&#8217;s pretty clear now that Google Wave is the biggest failure of the beta international hype machine. Such a bloated useless application. It&#8217;s been so long since I logged on it and I don&#8217;t have any wave updated (even the ones that should be welcoming different users). Lame.</p>

<p>_PS: Thinking, Wave is the second place of the hype machine failures. Clearly Mendeley is first. _</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>But, I guess, it can be easily refactored/enhanced/despised by the
audience that read or have access to this blog via Planet Python.
Anyway, for someone like me, whose main task now is not to generate tons
of code and lines, I think the code (or part of it) that I will present
below is quite good. Feel free to comment, criticize and say bad and
good things about it. We needed a script that would take files coming
out from protein search engines that would be able to compare the
peptides and protein sequences, their abundance and some other
characteristics. We had a combination of protein and peptide files, with
a list of proteins (one protein per line in a tab delimited file) that
was related to a list of peptides in another file (one peptide per line,
with multiple peptides/lines related to one protein in the original
list). Also each line in both files had more than 50 columns, and 8 or
16 of them were the values we wanted to extract. I say 8 or 16 of them
because we didn&#8217;t know how many will output each time, as it would
depend on the number of samples per run (4 to 8 samples) . So, we had a
couple of issues: we didn&#8217;t know how many proteins would be output
(actually found) in each file, we wouldn&#8217;t know how many peptides for
each protein would be found and we didn&#8217;t know before hand how many
samples would be run at once. One good thing is that the 8-16 columns of
values were fixed, always in the same position and with empty cells if
no value was registered there. And we had a fourth problem: usually the
samples attributions would be random, meaning a control could come in
the first value column or could come in the last. And a fifth as we
didn&#8217;t know before hand (the tech knew) how many treatments would be run
each time. A treatment could be a different experimental condition, a
sample grouping or some other extraneous factor. An extra issue is that
we would need to compare multiple files, and get protein and peptide
abundances in all of them at the same time and finally compare each
treatment. Basically, in order to create an universal script we needed
something flexible enough that whatever the experiments threw at use we
would be able to handle. First step we decided to use a YAML file that
could be filled by the experimental researchers with sample assignments,
treatments, etc. The YAML would look like this B0: - 114: A - 115: D -
116: B - 117: C B1: - 114: C - 115: A - 116: D - 117: B In this file B0
and B1 would be the result file names, 114 is the column/channel where
the sample was run and and A, B, C and D the treatment. With this set,
out objective was to get all proteins and their peptides for treatment A
in files B0 and B1, do some calculation and them compare to all proteins
and peptides from treatment B, C and D extracted also from files B0 and
B1. First step was to get the names of the treatments from the YAML file
[sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]]def get_treatments(mapping): treats =
set([]) for entry in mapping: [treats.add(list(t.values())[0]) for t in
mapping[entry]] return treats[/sourcecode] where [code]mapping[/code] is
the YAML file name. We used a set to store and sets have unique items,
and treatment names can vary from file to file. In the code above we
basically read the YAML and the value for each entry. We then needed a
class to store protein information, and there was the story got hairy.
With all my (lack of ) experience, I decided to use [code]exec[/code]
statements to fix all the uncertainty of the experimental data details.
I didn&#8217;t have the treatment names before hand (or in a fixed immutable
list), and didn&#8217;t have the columns (channels) that were being used at
the time and I have to correctly assign each protein abundance (area) to
its place. In the end our class look like this [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]class Protein(): &#8220;&#8221;&#8220;Class Protein, stores all the
information about channels and areas, name and accession&#8221;&#8220;&#8221; def
__init__(self, accession, name, treatments): self.accession =
accession self.name = name #ratio channels are called based on their
name for i in treatments: exec(&#8216;self.%s = []&#8217; %i) exec(&#8216;self.area%s =
[]&#8217; %i) def add_to_channel(self, channel, peptide):
exec(&#8216;self.%s.append(peptide)&#8217; % channel) def add_to_area(self,
channel, area): exec(&#8216;self.area%s.append(area)&#8217; % channel)[/sourcecode]
In order to be faithful to this blog&#8217;s name, I will explain how the code
above is supposed to work. First, [code]exec[/code] is a Python
statement that support dynamic execution of code. In our case above it
was used to name the objects, so we would be able to access them by name
in subsequent functions. Let&#8217;s take this for example [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]for i in treatments: exec(&#8216;self.%s = []&#8217; %i)
exec(&#8216;self.area%s = []&#8217; %i)[/sourcecode] In this snippet we were trying
to create lists called (for the YAML file above) A, B, C and D, and
another set of lists called areaA, areaB, areaC and areaD. Let&#8217;s say for
another experiment we would have treatments &#8220;Control&#8221;, &#8220;Low&#8221; and &#8220;High&#8221;
and so on. The next two functions use the same approach, with exec, this
time appending to the freshly created lists. This way it&#8217;s easy to
control what the user is throwing at us. I don&#8217;f know if this the best
approach possible, or if it is or not harmful. Maybe experts reading
this might have better ideas, and I appreciate them. We check the rest
of the script next time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Expanding a bit from what was posted yesterday on the Bioinformatics investment topic, the main investment we need to make is in personnel, courses. Is not admissible that in 2010 a graduate student doesn&#8217;t know some simple (I mean the really, really, really simple) Excel function/macro functionality. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the student is in a bioinfo/computational biology stream or not (it would be worse, then) or any other stream, this is basic stuff that most of the advanced students should know.</p>

<p>We have to forget apologies, such as &#8220;I don&#8217;t like computers&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m not good with machines&#8221;, etc. These are present and future scientists, the top of the top students, they should know basic computer usage and management. I don&#8217;t want them at graduate school to be able to modify a makefile and compile some obscure boost-related library on Solaris, just use a &#8220;=IF A1=0, nothing, yes&#8221; in Excel. If we don&#8217;t teach them in the future I will still receive FASTA sequences in Word docs, and coloured tables in Excel. These are the best mind out there, they should devote maybe 5% of their time for these things, it&#8217;s not just beneficial for me but for them and for science in general too.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know where are the mistakes, the failures, what we can do, but we need to do something. And to do something we need money, and not a lot of it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And a lot of it, but not to buy larger machines, or to create big departments or institute. Not even research investment. Bioinformatics needs investment in people, in courses, in workshops, in good practices for software development, in a knowledge base. Although, some people said sometime ago that &#8220;Bioinformatics is (was) dead&#8221;, the future is only bioiformatical ®. When was the last time you saw a bank branch with no computers?</p>

<p>No, I don&#8217;t pirate them either. But whenever I buy something I get highly disappointed. Recently I bought <a href="http://www.tuneupmedia.com/blog/">TuneUp</a>, which is a iTunes plugin for Macs. It seems to work great, most of the time at least, bu every time I add one song to the library, it tries to re-sync with it, and it usually takes hours and hours. Really frustrating.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why is better to stick to free stuff and donate when you feel like doing it. Sometimes it&#8217;s better.</p>
