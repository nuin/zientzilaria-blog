  <div class="entry-content"><p>Feynman summarizes everything I think about awards, prizes and societies in science. No, I never won anything, and if I do someday (remote probability) I will decline it.</p>

<p>This only reminds me more and more about some scientists websites that first mention their awards, prizes and interviews before any scientific content. You know who you are.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can count in one hand how many times I&#8217;ve ever been in a ultra organized scientific lab. In some of them I don&#8217;t know how people work and are able to publish results obtained in the lab. Because of that and inspired by the countless <em>reality</em> TV shows, I decided to start pitching the idea of the <strong>Laboratory Walkover</strong>.</p>

<p>We will come to your lab with a TV crew, a interior designer and a high level authority in your field of research and we are going to stop to nothing to make your lab the best research space on earth. You won&#8217;t need to pay a dime for the makeover/walkover/takeover, on the contrary we will give you $5000 for consumables and a new PCR machine (if applicable).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m already looking for sponsors and channels, and if you want your lab o qualify for the walkover, send me a picture.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s really strange to read so many negative stories about the iPad, why it will fail, why it sucks, etc, etc. So many bytes wasted (including these here) to cover something that nobody used yet, no one has ever seen, nor was actually released. So many bytes wasted on stories about something that, if you don&#8217;t like and think Apple and Steve Jobs are trying to control their users/customers, you have full control of: like it, buy it, don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t buy it.</p>

<p>So many stories about how closed source computer, software is being forced upon fearful customers. While we worry about that, in the US, companies, corporations are now persons.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really like reading some articles posted on Hacker News. Usually they focus on the entrepreneur side of the software/web business, but sometimes there are some nice pointers to scientific stuff. And most of the comments are also really nice, a lot of clever people around there. But this is what you expect of these virtual communities. Anyway, I&#8217;m here to talk about PLoS.</p>

<p>Yesterday somebody posted at HN, an article about open access to publications: <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69353-open-access-to-scientific-publications/fulltext">Open Access to Scientific Publications The good, the bad, and the ugly</a>. It&#8217;s a so-so read, but gives some information on the current scenario of open and closed access publishers. But what really caught my eye (thanks initially to a comment on HN) is this passage:</p>

<blockquote><p>But how much are authors ready to pay to publish an article? A few hundred dollars? The most prominent Open Access publisher, the Public Library of Science (PLOS), is a nonprofit organization that has received several million dollars in donations. Yet it charges between $1,350 and $2,900 per paper, depending on the journal.d In fact, many in the profession estimate that to be sustainable, the author-pay model will need to charge up to $5,000â€“$8,000 per publication.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are seven journals on PLoS, with an average publication fee of $2125. In average each journal publishes around 310 papers per year [I took Computational Biology (388 pubs) and Neglected Tropical Diseases (236 pubs) for 2009]. With the fees and number of publications in each journal being quite similar, that the total revenue for one year is around $4,000,000. From the article we have the idea that these fees should be (and will be) higher in the future, from double to quadruple of what we see now. This, of course, will double or quadruple the revenue. The <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1081228">comment</a> on HN that made me read the article is this:</p>

<blockquote><p>WTF? $8000 per article would pay for each article to have its own EC2 instance for >10 years, including bandwidth costs. Something not right there&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, something is not right here. With the costs of hardware infrastructure going down every day, nothing justifies these fees (or a bit of them) to &#8220;host it [publication] on a server that is accessible around the clock.&#8221; I really like PLoS, but in almost no time is becoming another publishing company. I don&#8217;t know if PLoS financial books are open, and if not, don&#8217;t you think they should be open too?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just sayin&#8217;. With all the negative reviews, ponderations, blog posts, newspaper reports, I just wanted to give so kudos to Steve and the Apple family. Is it the best product ever? No. Is it the next coming of Jesus Christ? No. So what is it? It&#8217;s just another product, and you, only you (maybe with your wife/husband/partner/household) will decide if it fits your budget, if it is useful for you and if you actually need to buy it. Apart from that, rants are always good for the people that writes them (I know it firsthand).</p>

<p>The icing on the cake is when I overheard two homeless guys discussing if you could multitask on an iPad. When they discovered you couldn&#8217;t, they decided not to buy it. Last time I saw them they were in the public library computers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>than the lack of funding, than the publishing companies, than old-fashioned scientists, than <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/01/poor_science_standard_in_minne.php">PZ Meyers</a>, more than Linux, more than Apple, more than anything I know.</p>

<p>Ok, let me explain then. But before that, a disclaimer: I own Windows 95, 98, XP and Vista, and this represents only my opinion, not the opinion of my employers, co-workers and family.</p>

<p>And why is MSFT more detrimental to Science than anything else? It&#8217;s simple: the openness of their system. Maybe open is not the right word, transparency might better to explain it. As MSFT has the leadership on the OS market, vendors tend to attach their products (in this case laboratory equipments, analysis software, etc) to the OS. And how that is bad? Because when it works, it works fine, but when it doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s a nightmare. Software registry that fails, legacy software that doesn&#8217;t work even when compatibility mode, no control over installation protocols. Most of the time you also don&#8217;t have free/open source tools that help you solver the problem.</p>

<p>After all this, you have to throw in license costs, expensive certification for sys admin in order to manage the machines, time wasted troubleshooting applications, OS, updates, etc. All of this drag all the way up and all the way down the Scientific ladder, increasing costs all over the board, and man-months of work that could be used in different aspects of research.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not advocating either OS X, Linux, BSD or Solaris, I&#8217;m just saying that these systems are easier to use, cheaper (maybe not OS X) and provide a better experience to the users. And I&#8217;m not advocating that &#8220;regular&#8221; users should migrate to these systems, I&#8217;m just saying that if you are cost conscious scientist, they are a better alternative. Maybe if every university had an introduction to Linux/Unix course, maybe we would be able to cut costs every where, have better scientists and work more efficiently with our computers.</p>

<p>Do you think universities would have a course like this? I don&#8217;t think so, but it would be nice to see.</p>
