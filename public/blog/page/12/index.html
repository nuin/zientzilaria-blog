  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t like Facebook, the same way I don&#8217;t like Orkut. The only reason for me to use Facebook is contact people I don&#8217;t see in years, and that facet of it I appreciate. On the other hand I really liked FriendFeed, which is (was) a great service, but didn&#8217;t have a commercialization plan, hence it was sold.</p>

<p>Anyway, the best analogy I can make of this purchase is: It&#8217;s like when that indie, miniscule band that you love and cherish goes mainstream. In a matter of seconds, the whole world knows that band and you don&#8217;t like it anymore, because you &#8220;discovered&#8221; it, because they were &#8220;connected&#8221; only to you, not the whole world.</p>

<p>Now, FriendFeed is Facebook, and Facebook is mainstream, and we scientists need to stay indie, or at least keep our inner selves in a indie environment. Not that Twitter is still indie, but at least they haven&#8217;t sold their souls to the capitalist devil.</p>

<p>Hey, I just said it was an analogy, you&#8217;re not supposed to like my bands, they&#8217;re mine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(this will be a weekly post on the most important news of the week, things that caught our eyes here at Blind.Scientist headquarters)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Apparently there is a rich guy on the internet that likes to show off how many computers he has, but doesn&#8217;t know a lot about technology and stuff. Anyway, <a href="http://calacanis.com/2009/08/08/the-case-against-apple-in-five-parts/">how not to write a post</a>. Never used his website.</p></li>
<li><p>Skulpt is a nice project that I really like to see come to fruition. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/skulpt/">Check it out</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Universal health care, or whatever it will be, in US won&#8217;t be approved, because both parties are in the pocket of the (un)health industry. It&#8217;s like the joke where the father doctor leaves for vacation and leaves the clinic for his newly graduated son to take care. When he comes back, all his patients are cured, and the father says: &#8220;What the hell have you done? These patients paid for your university tuition with the care I provided for 20 years&#8221;. Things are getting so paradoxical down there that conservatives start brawls, get beaten up and then ask for donations to cover medical bills, <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics/story/1373035.html">because they don&#8217;t have insurance</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You have to <a href="http://imgur.com/5RkJK.png">say no to socialism</a>, you know why, don&#8217;t you?</p></li>
<li><p>Turns out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_people">Basques</a> were <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/5978900/Worlds-oldest-map-Spanish-cave-has-landscape-from-14000-years-ago.html">pioneers in cartography</a> too.</p></li>

<p>The paper of this week touches a subject that I have been involved in the past: sequence simulation. INDELible, by Fletcher and Yang, is a program that is capable of simulating both DNA and amino acid sequences, and it seems to be the complete package to do so. It contains several substitution models and it can even simulate codon substitutions.</p>

<p>As the article mentions, the closest comparison to INDELible is DAWG, developed by Reed Cartwright, that seems to be faster. DAWG is a nice program and generates good simulations and has a very well designed code with strong models and quite reliable results. And that&#8217;s what you want on a simulation program. You really want is a good implementation of the amino acid/nucleotide substitution pattern and a good model of indel simulation. It seems that INDELible has all of that, based on the publication (I haven&#8217;t tested yet).</p>

<p>Sequence simulation is usually a fringe field (if there is such field) in bioinformatics and phylogenetics/evolution. We usually forget that the best alignment and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> reconstruction is basically the best estimate with the methods we have. There&#8217;s no way to prove or test different alignment methods and programs without a solid <em>in silico</em> simulation or a hand curated alignment. And I think the simulation is better and can generate much more input than meticulously curating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment">sequence alignment</a>. Also, there is the need to test for phylogenetic reconstruction methods, and nothing better than good simulation packages that can mimic perfectly evolutionary phenomena.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to test INDELible and see what it is capable of. The only complaint that I have is that it uses yet another markup language as the control file. Why not use YAML or some other markup language? That would make usage more straightforward, but at least the authors provided a tutorial section on their website.</p>

<p>This is a new series here at the Blind.Scientist headquarters. My team and I will try to feature one scientific publication a week, it might not be hot from the presses or it might not be only about biology and/or bioinformatics. We (my team and I) will try to be eclectic and cover different areas. Alternatively you will find these posts on Research Blogging too.</p>

<p>This week we start with a recent publication that appeared on PLoS Computational Biology, titled <strong>A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects</strong>, by William Stafford Noble (reference and link are on the bottom of the post). It&#8217;s a well written publication, that falls under the Education scope of this PLoS, understandably by its title. Mainly it tries to teach some tips and tricks on how to organize your files in a directories (folders) and subdirectories (subfolders). Believe me, all advices in the paper are sound, but only if you know nothing about computers or you&#8217;re just starting using them.</p>

<p>Apparently the author focused on newcomers to the bioinformatics field, mainly biologists learning the skills and not computer scientists making the jump. In my opinion this is the wrong focus. Hardly these days you find some summer student, even the ones that go directly to the wet-lab, with no computer skills. The kids come to the lab these days knowing how to program, or at least with good notion of scripting and they have used computers basically their whole lives. This paper should have been focused on old timers, like myself, and go deeper into the subject. We, old timers, already have a lot of baggage and a lot of bad habits on daily work, and we read this with a scorn on our faces. We read this and say (or think) &#8220;why do I need to do things this way?&#8221;. We need this kind of advice, but I don&#8217;t know if this is something that should be granted a scientific publication. Any computer scientist fresh from graduation and starting at some multi-national company would laugh at this and maybe think why do biologists need to put this on paper, or PDF files and even have it on a scientific journal.</p>

<p>Most of the tips presented in the paper, at least for me, are a mere declaration of what common sense should be applied to manage digital files. I&#8217;ve been in the trenches, I suffered with my own disorganization, and I learned from it and from a myriad of blogs and websites devoted to software design and development. These references not only give you a perspective on what the real world of software and project development looks like (or should be) but they teach you how to survive in the jungle of &#8220;databases&#8221; stored in Excel files.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really sad that in 2009 we need to read these kind of papers, or even a paper with this subject is published. I know dozens of bioinformaticians that would be able write an identical or better publication, but decide not to write it because this is basically common sense, or maybe they wrote the same thing in their blog. Some of them will scratch their heads and think this was a sure thing, an easy publication where they just needed to write about what they do daily. Just browse some Bioinformatics and Computational Biology blogs and you will get more and better advice than you get from PLoS and this paper.</p>

<p>We need more papers like my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/jandot">Jan Aerts</a> and his colleague published on Ruby and Bioinformatics. That&#8217;s a paper that makes you want more and gives you a primer to do more. It&#8217;s not a paper about common sense. But, hey, not everyone has it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Believe me, The Shock Doctrine is an excellent book. It&#8217;s well written, an eye-opener of current, and past, economics and social issues. But at the same time it fails in some aspects, always portraying what is left of the right as the best solution and what is right of the left as the bad alternative.</p>

<p>As any good leftist writing, the book tries to explain facts that don&#8217;t fit on the perfect picture the author is trying to paint (I bet right-wing authors would do the same). When explaining about the Argentinean and Chilean dark years, Naomi Klein mentions en passant, Brazil as another example of Friedmanism economics. She dedicates long passages of the book to the Cone Sul, which Brazil is also part of (in less extent than Argentina and Chile) and sometimes she puts Brazil in the mix of some economic decisions in the region. It turns out, although under a dictatorship regime, a right-wing one, Brazil never &#8220;suffered&#8221; of Friedmanism, the ports were not open, no privatization, no liberal agenda. That would happen firstly with a right-wing elected president and secondly with a left-wing elected president. The author also fails to understand that South-America left and right are identical, and some of the centre is always in power, no matter who is power.</p>

<p>Also, in one of the final chapters of the book, Naomi starts to praise the new &#8220;leadership&#8221; of South America, Lula, Chavez, Correa, Zulaya, Morales and the whole gang of perfect latin-american idiots and the whole gang of illiterate that vote on them. In one the passages she mentions that Evo Morales sent &#8220;the Army to take back the gas fields from multinational &#8216;plunderers&#8217;&#8221;. The so-called multinational plunderers were the Brazilian gas and oil company, Petrobras, which is a public company managed by the government of Brazil, praised in the book for showing a new style of leadership.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think Naomi Klein will ever read this page, but if she does I have an advice for her. Naomi, you&#8217;re Canadian, and apparently a competent person. I was born in Brazil, and left the country six years ago, and now I live in Canada. So, my southern spot is open, you can take it. Go live in Brazil, Naomi, but not for six months and guided by someone from the &#8220;social movement&#8221;. Go find a job, go raise a family, go buy food, a car, be shot on the streets. Go see how the left-wing (at least the label is) is so corrupt as any other any-wing government. Go see the hospitals, the palaces from the senators, go buy your book with a ten fold price increase. I guess only the ones that suffered through a populist South American government should be allowed to write a book about them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I usually don&#8217;t get personal with software reviews. I even praised TNT in the past for being extremely fast, even though it mainly does maximum parsimony. But Mendeley&#8217;s case is outstanding and their attempt to censor me, makes things personal. I&#8217;m the closest you can get to be a &#8220;no one&#8221; in the scientific realm, I have this blog, a site needing updates and a couple of applications that no one uses. I still have a voice, maybe a smallish one, but I have. And I don&#8217;t like hype. And I&#8217;m a masochist.</p>

<p>So, after reading several hype-like entries on the internet about how hyper-super-duper is the new Mendeley&#8217;s version, I decided to go against the attempted censorship (I guess everyone at Mendeley Corp, or Inc, vote for BNP) and common sense, and downloaded the latest version of the software.</p>

<p>As usual, I installed the application, this time on a Macbook (dual core) with 4Gb of RAM and running the latest version of Leopard. First step was to get a directory with some PDF files and import into the application. I found one in my backup disk with a little bit over 1000 files and selected it to be imported. Last couple of times that used Mendeley, I tried importing about the same number of files and the performance was horrible. On this first test on OS X, I must admit that Mendeley was a little bit better, as it &#8220;only&#8221; took 32 minutes to import the files. But I&#8217;m not mentioning that it need almost two cores to do it, peaking at 170% of CPU usage and almost 1 Gb of RAM. Of course, you expect to do it only once, so my advice is that you do it on a desktop (or maybe on a laptop not on your lap) and on a winter day (for people on tropical countries, I&#8217;m sorry) as the CPU temperature will go up considerably.</p>

<p>After importing the files, it was time to check (again!) how bad the recognition was done. I learned that I have a lot of papers titled &#8220;BMC Bioniformatics&#8221; and &#8220;Bioinformatics application note&#8221;, which I guess are really hot research topics nowadays. Then I went to check the über-hyped PDF viewing capabilities. I double clicked on a random entry and the first page was displayed almost immediately, which is quite an achievement for this application. I tried scrolling down and the beachball came. I let Mendeley play with the ball for an hour and when I came back they were like good ol&#8217; pals on the beach. I then force quit the application and Leopard was relieved. Sent the bug report to Apple, hoping they are not swamped with Mendeley errors (I imagine some random engineer in Cupertino scratching his/her head and saying &#8220;What the hell is Mendeley?&#8221;). After the said hour and quitting it, I restarted Mendeley. And this brings me to Mendeley&#8217;s interface.</p>

<p>And I must say on a Mac it looks awful. It&#8217;s like eating kidney pie (I&#8217;ve never had kidney pie, so I&#8217;m just guessing). What Papers have of style and charm, Mendeley have of blandness and lack of style. I might have become a Mac snob, but Mendeley is just Windows-ish. Windows 95, I mean. The toolbar, on PDF view mode is hideous, with icons that have the flair of a Ford Pinto. The list view is also very bland and screams of lack of style. They employ Ricardo Vidal, who creates great logos and drawings and is also an expert on things that look good, but they still choose to follow the hideous path. I don&#8217;t think I have commented on Mendeley&#8217;s interface before, maybe because I was testing it on Windows, which is an OS not known for great interfaces anyway.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s the state of Mendeley? If you remove all the hype and the PR, you might say it&#8217;s an moderately good application, that still has years and years of work ahead to become a good application. But that&#8217;s the problem of hype and PR: you expect Mendeley to be the software that will solve all your bibliographical needs and make you a cheese and ham sandwich at the end of the day. It&#8217;s far from it, and if the hype-PR machine wasn&#8217;t there I would give a break to all the major flaws that a beta application has.   Poor code (greedy, CPU- and memory-hoarding), ugly and bland interface, poor PDF recognition and slow PDF rendering when panning pages (I haven&#8217;t tested the web capability. I&#8217;m not that masochist!).</p>

<p>Summarizing, Mendeley still sucks and the PR doesn&#8217;t help it work better.</p>

<p>Comments are open, let the bashing begin.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Yes, you do. I know because you&#8217;re hip, right? No. Do you want to publish a paper about it? Yes. But that&#8217;s so 2008. Shouldn&#8217;t you wait for Google Wave? Maybe.</em></p>

<p>Now, seriously. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://friendfeed.com/sciphu/4bf7c857/on-challenges-of-conference-blogging-genetic">current discussion on the subject</a> after CSHL threatened to forbid anyone to liveblog/tweet/friendfeed presentations at their conferences if they don&#8217;t follow the usual rules for media coverage.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s outrageous! No, it&#8217;s not. That&#8217;s what they want to do, let them do it. They have the right to forbid anyone to broadcast whatever is going on during presentations at the conferences they organize. They are organizing it, they are paying for it (relatively speaking) and they spent time organizing it. Whenever you registered, if there are rules specifying what you should or shouldn&#8217;t do you have two options: either you register or not. It&#8217;s simple.</p>

<p><em>Oh, but the Nobel Prize Winner John Doe will be speaking there. Really? So you really want to go? Yes. Then register. But I cannot liveblog/tweet/friendcast/whatever, so I won&#8217;t have enough street cred when I discuss things online. So, don&#8217;t go. But you want to go? Yes. So follow the rules. But I don&#8217;t like the rules. Me neither, but they are rules.</em></p>

<p>Another aspect is the availability of wireless internet. If you don&#8217;t want people broadcasting the presentations, simply do not provide wireless internet. And be sure to confiscate blackberries at the door. The last big meeting that I attended was in the 2005 ISMB in Detroit, and I found, back then, very disrespectful to whoever was speaking that some people in the audience would surf, work and answer emails. Either you&#8217;re at the conference to follow the talks or you&#8217;re there to get air miles, a free trip or different cuisine (not the case of Detroit). You&#8217;re not there to work in a different environment. If you have things to work, stay outside the talks.</p>

<p><em>But you really want to liveblog/tweet/friendcast the presentation? How do you I know that you&#8217;re doing that or just answering an email? You don&#8217;t check emails during talks? Even if the talk is boooring? No. OK.</em></p>

<p>But the main point is we have to follow the rules that the organizer sets. We might like it or not. We can register or boycott the meeting. Yes, that&#8217;s a better idea boycott the meeting and do not give money to whoever sets rules you don&#8217;t like. Please, have principles. Don&#8217;t cave in because that researcher you love is going to present there, send him/her an email asking for a boycott of the meeting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I last criticized Mendeley for being an horrible software and received an email from one of the lads there, threatening and censoring (attempting) me, I have this unnerving feeling. Apparently Mendeley website (or whatever they use there) got a facelift and my comment on FriendFeed was &#8220;still sucks&#8221;. Not the facelift, the software, but this is a side note to the story. Another user there said that I need to &#8220;self-censor&#8221; my comment because they are &#8220;unfair, aggressive and insulting&#8221;. A two-word comment &#8230;</p>

<p>So, what should I do? Cave in to the power of the mass and put my head down and say I&#8217;m sorry? Should I not comment there anymore? Should I stop saying that Mendeley sucks because the guys there are soooooooooooo nice, OMG? Should I lie and say that&#8217;s a wonderful software? All of the above?</p>

<p>I will not do any of the above. I stand behind my comments, and after I received a censoring email, I feel that I have to defend my comments. If we&#8217;re not able to tell the truth online, even if it hurts someone else&#8217;s feelings, I&#8217;m sorry but anyone should be allowed to comment, nowhere.</p>
