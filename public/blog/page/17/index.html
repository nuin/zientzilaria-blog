  <div class="entry-content"><p>It started <a href="http://network.nature.com/groups/nnbloggername/forum/topics/3392">here</a> and I got it from <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/11/the_science_blog_meme.php">here</a>. Here are my responses:</p>

<p><strong>1. What is your blog about?</strong></p>

<p>Anything that I wish I had done and willing to do. Also there are interviews (I want to do more!).</p>

<p><strong>2. What will you never write about?</strong></p>

<p>Confidential stuff, anything that is very personal or people do not want to publicize. Send me a message if you want to know the latest gossip in Bioinformatics.</p>

<p><strong>3. Have you ever considered leaving science?</strong></p>

<p>Nope, but sometimes I have the feeling that I would like to be a airplane pilot.</p>

<p><strong>4. What would you do instead?</strong></p>

<p>Airplane pilot? F1 mechanic?</p>

<p><strong>5. What do you think will science blogging be like in 5 years?</strong></p>

<p>Oh boy, I dunno. Ask me in five years, if I&#8217;m still around.</p>

<p><strong>6. What is the most extraordinary thing that happened to you because of blogging?</strong></p>

<p>Extraordinary? Nothing. If you call extraordinary befriending someone, than I can say that is. Being able to feel part of a community, that&#8217;s a good one.</p>

<p><strong>7. Did you write a blog post or comment you later regretted?</strong></p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p><strong>8. When did you first learn about science blogging?</strong></p>

<p>Nodalpoint was the catalyst. I knew about blogging for quite sometime, but Maddox influenced me not to, until I found out Nodalpoint.</p>

<p><strong>9. What do your colleagues at work say about your blogging?</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;What blog?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>10. Extra credit: are you able to write an entry to your blog that takes the form of a poem about your research?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. If you want to read it, leave a comment. If I get 20 comments, I will post it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s see now how do we connect our GUI to the the pymotif file (I
changed the name because of some conflicts with the app name [my bad!],
the git repo was updated accordingly). And also how to display the
results, in a simpler manner. Ok, first to connecting the script to the
function file, pymotif.py. The file is already imported in our script
and we have used it before. We need to find the exact point and which
parameters to pass. pytmotif.py is a slightly modified version of your
command line script, and the code is below. [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]#!/usr/bin/env python import fasta import sys from
collections import defaultdict def choose(n, k): if 0 &lt;= k &lt;= n: ntok =
1 ktok = 1 for t in xrange(1, min(k, n - k) + 1): ntok *= n ktok *= t
n -= 1 return ntok // ktok else: return 0 def get_quorums(seqs, mlen):
&#8221;&#8221;&#8221; add seq id_no to a set use explicit counter to create seq_no &#8220;&#8221;&#8221;
quorum = defaultdict(int) for seq in seqs: for n in range(len(seq) -
mlen): quorum[seq[n:n + mlen]] += 1 return quorum def
calculate_motifs(input_seqs, input_seqs2): input_seqs =
fasta.read_seqs(open(&#8216;celladhesion1000.fa&#8217;).readlines()) input_seqs2 =
fasta.read_seqs(open(&#8216;celladhesion1000C.fa&#8217;).readlines()) foreground =
get_quorums(input_seqs, 10) background = get_quorums(input_seqs2,
10) N = len(input_seqs) + len(input_seqs2) res_motifs = [] for i in
foreground: term1 = choose(background[i], foreground[i]) term2 =
choose((N - background[i]), len(input_seqs) - 1) term3 = choose(N,
len(input_seqs)) p = (float(term1) * float(term2)) / term3 if 0 &lt; p &lt;=
0.0001: res_motifs.append(i + &#8216;t&#8217; + str(foreground[i]) + &#8216;t&#8217; +
str(background[i]) + &#8216;t&#8217; + str(p)) res_motifs.sort() return
res_motifs[/sourcecode] So, basically the line we are interested is
this one [sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]def
calculate_motifs(input_seqs, input_seqs2):[/sourcecode] We replace
the wx.MessageBox line in our run_finder function and use the input
files selected by the user as parameters for calculate_motifs, and we
are done [sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]def run_finder(self, event):
result = pymotif.calculate_motifs(self.fore_file,
self.back_file)[/sourcecode] Very simple and direct. This should take
care of everything except the motif width, what we will see in the next
post. We still need a place to write the overrepresented motifs. We can
add a text box to the frame, and we do that by adding an extra
declaration in our __do_layout function. This time we need to add
some extra style to the box, so it can show multiple lines and has a
scroll bar. [sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]self.results =
wx.TextCtrl(panel, -1, &#8221;, (150, 50), (200, 100), wx.TE_MULTILINE |
wx.TE_AUTO_SCROLL | wx.HSCROLL)[/sourcecode] Notice the wx. flags
added. MULTILINE allows the box to have multiple lines and the other two
turn on the auto scroll and horizontal scroll. Great. And how do we
write the results. Notice above that the function that calculates the
motifs, returns a list where each item has the motif sequence and the p
value, sorted. So the only thing we need to do is to iterate over the
list and print each line to the result box. That simple, and we
accomplish it by using the WriteText method, that receives as a
parameter a string, either literal or a string object. Our run_finder
function will have a couple of extra lines [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]def run_finder(self, event): result =
pymotif.calculate_motifs(self.fore_file, self.back_file) for motif in
result: self.results.WriteText(motif + &#8216;n&#8217;)[/sourcecode] That will
present in a very simplistic way the resulting overrepresented motifs,
but it&#8217;s enough for now. Our GUI script will be [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]#!/usr/bin/env python import wx import pymot import
pymotif import fasta import os class pymot(wx.App): def
__init__(self, redirect=False): wx.App.__init__(self, redirect)

filemenu.Append(-1, &#8216;Quit&#8217;) #appends the menu to the menubar and
creates it menubar.Append(filemenu, &#8216;File&#8217;) self.SetMenuBar(menubar)
#input box for motif width, and label self.one_label =

self.results = wx.TextCtrl(panel, -1, &#8221;, (150, 50), (200, 100),

file&#8217;, (10, 10)) self.back_label = wx.StaticText(panel, -1, &#8216;Select the

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First what is Open Science/Research? Have you ever heard of it (no, that&#8217;s not for the <a href="http://friendfeed.com/rooms/the-life-scientists">Life Scientists room on FriendFeed</a>)? Haven&#8217;t you? I thought of it.</p>

<p>As a &#8220;lay open scientist/researcher&#8221;, I decided to enter the belly of the beast, and the easiest way to do that was googling. Nice. Open and science returned me 98,500,000 links. Looks good. &#8220;Open science&#8221; returned a &#8220;mere&#8221; 200,000. What is the first search result? This <a href="http://www.openscience.org/blog/">one</a>. Looks exactly what I needed. Let&#8217;s check the about page &#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>The OpenScience project is dedicated to writing and releasing free and <strong>Open Source scientific software</strong>. We are a group of scientists, mathematicians and engineers who want to encourage a collaborative environment in which science can be pursued by anyone who is inspired to discover something new about the natural world.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah, open source software. Nope, not what I wanted (yes, I want open source software especially in science, but it&#8217;s not what I want right now).</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s check the second search result: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research</a>. Wikipedia, nice, good (second) place to start. OK, some definitions</p>

<blockquote><p>the central theme of open research is to make clear accounts of the methodology, along with data and results extracted therefrom, freely available via the internet. This permits a massively distributed collaboration.</p></blockquote>

<p>Great. But, even though the Wikipedia entry is open and anyone can edit it and add information, it&#8217;s not enough to feed my will to learn about open science. Knowing a bit about Wikipedia (remember I am a lay open scientist here and computers are not my forte), I go to the external links section and get the first one: <a href="http://openresearch.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenResearch.org</a>. Yes! that&#8217;s what I was looking for.</p>

<p>OpenResearch.org is a &#8220;a semantic Wiki aiming to collect scientific meta-data such as about calls for papers, tools, journals etc.&#8221; Great &#8230; wait what? A semantic what to collect what? I don&#8217;t know nothing (yes, double negative, my native language is no English, but I guess you guessed that, right?) about wikis, there&#8217;s Wikipedia, but wiki?</p>

<p>I go to the page and I don&#8217;t know where to start. There are so many links, so many pages, and I don&#8217;t know how to navigate this messy webpage and I don&#8217;t have time to learn. Let&#8217;s get the second link on Open Research entry on Wikipedia: <a href="http://www.philoptima.org/">Philoptima</a>, Open Research Marketplace &amp; Community. Just a sec, isn&#8217;t Open Research to be open to anyone interested, why do we need a market place for it? Ok, maybe I try some other time, because now I have to get back to do some research so I can get it in the open &#8230;</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>I think you guessed what is the moral of the story: there is no central repository of information about open research. I have to dig deeper, waste time, and if I already have a constrained schedule, I won&#8217;t do that. If I didn&#8217;t know the open science advocates, I will never have heard of some of their sites. Don&#8217;t expect a large group of people to make a huge effort to learn about it, what do they have to do to join the &#8220;next revolution&#8221;, how to navigate an horrible wiki user interface (much less learn how to edit it). And don&#8217;t let me started on collaborating online, sharing files, connecting to other computers, etc, etc (that&#8217;s another post).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not here to suggest anything to the open scientists, just point out what is wrong and why it will be a failure for some time to come. I may be wrong, but that&#8217;s easier than being right.Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/open%20science">open science</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/open%20research">open research</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/failure">failure</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/series">series</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/long">long</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wiki?">wiki?</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my spare time I like to tackle simple problems, like how to improve science. Here I present a straightforward proposition on how to at least multiply by a large fold productivity in labs, institutes, universities and academia in general. Productivity in this case is not only on number papers published, but also on resources consumption, time management, research achievements, etc. As you can see a small, trivial problem (I will use bullet point format, so it&#8217;s even clearer).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>create an efficient informatics support for the institution - yes, that&#8217;s true. At McMaster we had in the lab a informatics guy, that not only was able to administrate our small cluster but to advise on a number of things we needed. Problem: they were understaffed. So, let&#8217;s create an IT department, not only to administrate things, but to educate people and have bioinformaticians, chemoinformaticians, whatever-science-field-ician. I don&#8217;t want these guys doing science or competing for grants, I want this as a service and a competent one.</p></li>
<li><p>As an addition to our recently suggested IT-do-it-all department, let&#8217;s have a group of artists working on creating figures for papers, either hand drawing for those guys in morphology, or creating the latest visualization of nanotubes to those guys in nanoscience. OF course this should be a specialized group, with people from different areas working on streamlining graphical production for faculty and staff.</p></li>
<li><p>A science related marketing department, with PR people that actually know that molecular biology, quantum physics, paleontology is. MB is more than using micropipettes (yes, news reporters have a fetish with micropipettes, so everytime I see one talking about &#8220;genetics engineering&#8221; on TV, I tend to check the pipette brand the guys are using). After all science is done with mostly public money, and I bet there a bunch of geek kids interested in learning more and more. NBA is not for everyone (below 6&#8221;).</p></li>
<li><p>There are not enough positions? Let&#8217;s create new ranks. There are people out there that don&#8217;t want to be a PI, but don&#8217;t want to be post-docs for 10 years. There are people out there that don&#8217;t care if they are first in a publication or third, as long as he or she knows the contribution they gave to the research. Creating the above departments/services, it will be simple to create these new positions.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I might have more steps, but my spare time is short today. Maybe there is no money, or political will to do these kind of things, but I didn&#8217;t promise anything.</p>

<p>Next time, I will pitch in the oil crisis and Middle-East peace process. Prepare yourselves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s get back to the last post and check one line we entered\
\
[sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]self.motif_width = wx.TextCtrl(panel, -1,
&#8216;10&#8217;, (95, 50), (40,18))[/sourcecode]\
\
There is something in this line that I did not explain. The third
parameter in the test box declaration is <code>'10'</code>. How does this affect
our box? That&#8217;s the default text that will be displayed inside the box
as soon as it is created. In our case, 10 is the motif width, and it&#8217;s
the value we consider to be the most common search width.\
\
Another aspect not explained is the <code>run_finder</code>. We added a line \
\
[sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]wx.MessageBox(&#8216;It should run,
eh?&#8217;)[/sourcecode]\
\
where we declare a wx.MessageBox. What is it? A message box is the usual
error/information dialog that you see in most programs. In our case it
is very simple, just a warning/reminder that we need to include some
code there.\
\
Next time we will connect some Python source files and make our script
find some motifs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Flanders Fields
By John McCrae</p>

<p>In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly.
Scarce heard amid the guns below.</p>

<p>We are the dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow
Loved, and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.</p>

<p>Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last entry we saw how to allow the user to open a file. Now we need to
work on this file and store its path so the script can process it later
on. After the file is selected on the file menu, the filename is printed
on the label. Let&#8217;s think for a second &#8230; If we get only the filename
from the dialog, the program won&#8217;t work, because the file might be
located in another directory, partition, you name it. So we need tp get
the file&#8217;s full path. We need to change the lines [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]back_file = dialog.GetFilename()
self.fore_label.SetLabel(dialog.GetFilename())[/sourcecode] by
[sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]back_file = dialog.GetPath()
self.fore_label.SetLabel(back_file)[/sourcecode] (do not forget to do
the same to the fore_file!). Let&#8217;s run the script and check what
happens. The frame should look like the one below (with a little
stretching for me). <a href="http://python.genedrift.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gui4.png"><img src="http://python.genedrift.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gui4.png" title="new gui" alt="new
gui" /></a>
OK, so this is part is solved. As we haven&#8217;t planned our application
from the start, we will spend sometime thinking of the basic
functionality that we migth need. So far, we need one input box, where
the user can enter the motif width to be searched, and a button to start
the process. Fine, let&#8217;s add the input box. For this we also need an
extra label to tell the user what the box is for. Always working on our
__do_layout function we add two lines [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]self.one_label = wx.StaticText(panel, -1, &#8216;Motif
width&#8217;, (10,50)) self.motif_width = wx.TextCtrl(panel, -1, &#8216;10&#8217;, (95,
50), (40,18))[/sourcecode] Simple as that we have a input box. For the
button, one line will suffice [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]self.run_button = wx.Button(panel, -1, &#8216;Run&#8217;, (10,
80))[/sourcecode] As we can see there is not much difference in any of
the declarations, they follow a similar process and the parameters are
more or less identical in some of them. Now, we need to bind the button
to a function, that we will call <code>run_finder</code>. Remember that binding
needs an event type, a target function and an object. This time the
event is a button event, but the other two parameters are similar.
[sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]self.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON,
self.run_finder, self.run_button)[/sourcecode] and the function, for
now will look like [sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]def run_finder(self,
event): wx.MessageBox(&#8216;It should run, eh?&#8217;)[/sourcecode] That&#8217;s all for
today. Our script is growing and the full code is below [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]#!/usr/bin/env python import wx import pymot import
fasta import os class pymot(wx.App): def __init__(self,
redirect=False): wx.App.__init__(self, redirect) class

&#8221; self.back_file = &#8221; def __do_layout(self): #adding the panel
panel = wx.Panel(self) #defines the menubar menubar = wx.MenuBar()
#file menu filemenu = wx.Menu() foreground_menu = filemenu.Append(-1,
&#8216;Select foreground file&#8217;) background_menu = filemenu.Append(-1, &#8216;Select
background file&#8217;) sep = filemenu.AppendSeparator() quitmenu =
filemenu.Append(-1, &#8216;Quit&#8217;) #appends the menu to the menubar and
creates it menubar.Append(filemenu, &#8216;File&#8217;) self.SetMenuBar(menubar)
#input box for motif width, and label self.one_label =
wx.StaticText(panel, -1, &#8216;Motif width&#8217;, (10,50)) self.motif_width =
wx.TextCtrl(panel, -1, &#8216;10&#8217;, (95, 50), (40,18)) #run bbutton
self.run_button = wx.Button(panel, -1, &#8216;Run&#8217;, (10, 80)) #labels
self.fore_label = wx.StaticText(panel, -1, &#8216;Select the foreground
file&#8217;, (10, 10)) self.back_label = wx.StaticText(panel, -1, &#8216;Select the
background file&#8217;, (10, 30)) #binding the menus to functions
self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.on_foreground, foreground_menu)
self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.on_background, background_menu)
self.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.run_finder, self.run_button) def
on_foreground(self, event): dialog = wx.FileDialog(self, style=wx.OPEN)
if dialog.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK: fore_file = dialog.GetPath()
self.fore_label.SetLabel(fore_file) def on_background(self, event):
dialog = wx.FileDialog(self, style=wx.OPEN) if dialog.ShowModal() ==
wx.ID_OK: back_file = dialog.GetPath()
self.back_label.SetLabel(back_file) def run_finder(self, event):
wx.MessageBox(&#8216;It should run, eh?&#8217;) #if __name__ == &#8216;__main__&#8217;:
app = pymot() frame = pymotGUI(parent=None, id = -1)
#frame.CentreOnScreen() frame.Show() app.MainLoop()[/sourcecode]</p>
