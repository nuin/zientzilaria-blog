<p><em>(I&#8217;m really behind on my promise to post 365 in 365, four to keep the average on 1, three to go after this one)</em></p>

<p>In mid-October I went to Brazil, first to attend the 2009 X-Meeting in Angra dos Reis and for a first vacation period since 2005. When I moved to Canada, I wasn&#8217;t able to bring all the scientific literature I had amassed over the years, mostly stuff about frogs, evolution and phylogenetics. Nowadays printed or copied papers and out-of-date, PDF is the new in, so I decided to throw away most of the things I would be able to recover online later, but still keep some copies of rare stuff and original copies of papers.</p>

<p>Some of the original copies I saved where from the 50&#8217;s, 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s, and some of these contained the stamp that they belonged to Dr Crodowaldo Pavan (you can know more about his distinguished career on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crodowaldo_Pavan">his Wikipedia entry</a>). Dr Pavan died early in 2009, so these papers with his stamp now have more than its scientific merits, they have some sentimental value (for me at least). I got them when he was cleaning his office at the Biosciences Institute at USP, where he worked good part of his life.</p>

<p>I never had a lot of personal interaction with Dr Pavan, but I always read and learned about his work. But the strongest impact that I have from one of his presentations ( I think it was a round table) was in fact what I heard after it: Dr Pavan was an old fool and shouldn&#8217;t be invited to any other conference because his ideas were idiotic. This happened at one of the Brazilian Meeting of Genetics (mid/late 90&#8217;s), the most important genetics conference in Brazil, organized by the society that Dr Pavan helped creating and managing.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be surprised, that&#8217;s the way Brazil and Brazilians really treat the ones that accomplished something, the ones the opened the paths. Very typical, but I&#8217;m quite sure that Dr Pavan&#8217;s obituary(ies) was(ere) poetic and well-written, praising (deservedly) his career and work. I guess it was to late then to pay some respect while he was still alive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let me start by saying that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1584889292?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=genedrift-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1584889292">Python for Bioinformatics (Chapman &amp;

Biology)</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=genedrift-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1584889292" alt="image" />
is a massive book, massive in a way that it contains a lot of material.
I still didn&#8217;t have enough time to check everything, but I&#8217;m well into
the first section of the book that gives an initial view of Python and
how to program it. The initial section of the book is well written (I&#8217;m
not going criticize the book in terms of good/poor English, as I&#8217;m not
well qualified to do that), and gives a clear perspective on how to
program Python for scientists, who are the main target demographic of
the book. Of course, it always help to have some basic knowledge of
command line shells, but the book also includes some explanations of
IDLE and other Python-capable IDEs. I cannot say that I read this
section with the enough care and attention, but what I can say is that
you won&#8217;t miss a beat with PfB, as it has more material than I expected.
I still have to start with the more advanced topics, like
<a href="http://biopython.org/" title="Biopython">BioPython</a> and so forth, what I plan
to do in the coming month, and as I don&#8217;t have a lot of experience with
BioPython, I&#8217;m looking forward to it. On the other hand I have a
small-ish complaint, that maybe is more about style than substance. I
don&#8217;t like the design of the book, the way the code interleaves with the
text and the way the code explanations are presented. Most of the code
blocks are followed by a careful explanation, but this explanation works
as a figure label for the code block. That is quite annoying because
there are too many stops in the text fluidity as one tends to lose
attention to it (my case, not exactly everyone&#8217;s). Another minor detail
is the use of &#8220;he&#8221; every time scientists are referred (one example is on
page 3 on the second phrase of the introduction). The (politically)
correct would be to use &#8220;he or she&#8221; or &#8220;she or he&#8221; (but that&#8217;s OK with
me). I will try to post more complete reviews of the sections that I
don&#8217;t master. I would also like to thank Sebastian for sending me a copy
of the book.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the time of the Copenhagen meeting about climate change, Brazilian representatives were major protagonists, specially when criticizing all developed countries about their carbon emissions. The crook, also known as the Brazilian president, kept reminding everyone how advance Brazil is on &#8220;green&#8221; policies, how much native forests are still there, and saying the the developed countries have to do something to erase their polluted heritage.</p>

<p>Well, I don&#8217;t think many of my 3 readers (yes, I got an extra one this last week!) have ever been to Brazil, so I would like to list some of the lies about Brazilian &#8220;green&#8221; policies and actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br">São Paulo</a> is the largest city of the Southern Hemisphere, and there&#8217;s no effective recycling service. Now, imagine, 10+ million people not recycling, dumping sewage (non treated) on the rivers that cross the city, among other things do to the environment.</li>
<li>Add that to the 4+ million cars and buses emitting carbon during the average 2-3 hour commute in traffic jams</li>
<li>Add that to all major Brazilian cities</li>
<li>Ethanol technology is quite old in Brazil and that helps. What doesn&#8217;t help is the amount of native forest that has been cut to be used as sugarcane plantation, and to the fact that is cheaper to fill the tank with gas (most cars are flex fuels, most of the new cars, I mean)</li>
<li>Sugarcane crops are burnt for the harvest. Not every plantation has mechanized means.</li>
<li>Brazilian so-called green energy from hydro plants, is not so green.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s basically no railway transportation there, so everything moves inside trucks. And there&#8217;s almost none hydro transportation too.</li>
</ul>


<p>These are some quick examples, I guess if I spent ten more minutes, I would be able to come up with the double or triple. So, every time you hear that Brazil is an example of green country, and you end up feeling guilty that you live in a developed country that is harming the climate, don&#8217;t be.</p>
