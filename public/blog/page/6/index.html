  <div class="entry-content"><p>We found a way to make the Python script as good as or better than the
C++ executable. But for the analysis we need to do, motif counts are not
the value we want. We need the quorum: the number of sequences the motif
is present at least once. For instance, if the desired motifs was
<code>AAACCCTTTG</code> we will check in which sequences this word was present. Let&#8217;s
say in a cluster of 10 sequences, we would find it in sequences 1, 2, 3,
4 and 5, giving us a quorum of 5 out of 10, or 50%. The quorum will be
used in the future in the statistical calculation in order to determine
the overrepresented motifs. With only a couple of modifications, we can
adapt the script used to get the motif counts to get the quorum.</p>

<p> Basically, we change the way the
<code>defaultdict</code> is initialized, this time as a list instead of int and we
also change the procedure that used to get the counts. The loop does
identical work, iterating along the sequences, with a window (of the
input length) sliding on them and checking each word. This time instead
of incrementing the value of the <code>defaultdict</code>, we append to the list
the sequence number, obtained from a index integer variable (incremented
in each iteration of the loop), if this number is not already in the
list value. In the end each value of <code>quorum</code> will be a list os numbers
and by printing the list length we obtain the quorum. Testing the above
script there is no performance loss when comparing to the previous count
script. Next we will see which statistical method to use and start to
devising an script to calculate it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We take a break of developing code and check for performance (non-scientific testing!).</p>

<p>In the previous entry a simple file was used
as input: 8 DNA sequences of 500 bases each. That&#8217;s not enough to test
the performance of the Python script against the C++ compiled
executable. So, we use a larger file; two larger files to be more exact.</p>

<p>First, we use a 555 sequence file with the sequences averaging 19371
nucleotides and another with 3854 sequences averaging 20000 nucleotides
in length.</p>

<p>Those files were the largest foreground and background
clusters used in analysis. Let&#8217;s see how the Pyhton and C++ fared
(Linux&#8217;s time was used in the comparison, for simplicity).</p>

<p><strong>Foreground cluster</strong> Average of 10 runs <br/>
C++: 45.66 seconds<br/>
Python: 36.4 seconds</p>

<p><strong>Background cluster</strong> Average of 10 runs <br/>
C++: 5 minutes and 4 seconds<br/>
Python: 2 minutes and 44 seconds</p>

<p>The C++ analysis of the background
cluster was done on a cluster&#8217;s node, and not on my desktop computer,
due to the fact that my desktop could not handle it. C++ defense: the
code was developed by me and I am not a computer scientist. Clearly
there is room for improvement and performance gain. But, definitely we
can see that by using some advanced techniques in Python we are able to
outperform C++ (at least C++ code developed by me) and still have a
short and easy to read script. Next time we will change the Python&#8217;s
script output.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We move one on our search for overrepresented motifs in DNA sequences. I
was preparing this entry when the comments to part 1 arrived. Because of
that we will modify our previous code to include some suggestions and
then we will change t a little bit to output the actual values we want.
As Titus pointed out in his comment, when we merge the sequences we
generate errors, because we artificially including motifs that are not
supposed to be there. But in the end we will see that we are no after
the actual number of times a motif appears in the sequence and what
matters is the motif quorum. The main focus of the part one was to show
the decrease in code length from C++ to Python, introduce generator
functions and yield and also show the nice permutation function. Turns
out by using the approach of the previous entry there is a big drawback
in code execution, which is around 60 times slower than C++.</p>

<p>So we need
to find another approach, and Mike showed us how (with some small
modifications)</p>

<p>This time the counting is
done with a <code>defaultdict</code> initialized with integers (all zeroes), and
instead of generating all possible combinations (which was cool and
fast, but in the end made our script slower) a window with the input
length is slid along the each sequence and the key of the default
dictionary is the motif and the value is the actual count incremented as
we determine each motif. Checking this code performance using Linux&#8217;s
time, we get 0.2 seconds, an improvement of 5 fold on the C++ code and
300 fold on our previous Python code (Thanks Mike and everyone else for
the suggestions). What is different here is that the output is not
ordered and only the seen motifs are printed in the end. We will see
next time how to get the quorums.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Changing gears now, leaving behind Pfam alignments. I decided to start a
new series of posts based on the conversion of some small C++ programs I
developed in the past. These small programs (I call them modules because
they were part of a larger application) were used to count motifs, short
nucleotide <em>words</em> up to 10-12 base pairs, and then calculate
statistical overrepresentation of these words by comparing a foreground
set of DNA sequences against a background set.</p>

<p>We will start comparing
the different approaches of the C++ and the
<a href="http://python.org/" title="Python (programming language)">Python</a> codes and
point out advantages and disadvantages of doing it in one language or
the other.</p>

<p>First thing we need to do is to count the motifs in all
sequences from our foreground and background sets. For the project I was
working on, the ideal word length was 10 nucleotides. Basically our C++
approach to increase speed was to transform the character DNA sequences
into numbers and then, while sliding a window with the desired word
length,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" title="Hash function">hash</a> the
base-four numbers into base 10 and increment a vector position,
previously initialized with 0. For four nucleotides and a word size of
10 there are 1,048,576 permutations possible, from <code>AAAAAAAAAA</code> to
<code>TTTTTTTTTT</code>. Initially the C++ program would do</p>

<p>The whole C++ code has about 400 lines, including all the
possible output formatting and printing. Timing with <code>time</code> the C++
executable takes a little bit less than 2 seconds to read, count and
output different files. For Python, we will use a different approach and
gain a lot in code simplicity. As we want to count the number of times
size-10 words appear in all sequences, we first need to generate all
possible permutations (with replacement) of four nucleotides. This can
be easily accomplished by using generator functions. Regular functions
run until completion and the return a value. For instance, a function
that calculates the factorial of 10 will return the last value only,
after multiplying 10.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.</p>

<p>A generator function runs until a
value is available to return, <code>yielding</code> it and then suspending its
operation until called again. The yielding part was emphasized because
<code>yield</code> is the command used by Python to return the value and suspend
the function until further notice. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial" title="Factorial">factorial function</a>, a
generator would return the intermediary factorial values up to 10. To
generate all 1 million plus permutations of 4 nucleotides we need a
function similar to the one below (modified from
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/190465">here</a>)</p>

<p>Basically, what this generator function does is to combine all four
nucleotides in words of size 10. This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science">recursive
function</a> &#8220;Recursion (computer science)&#8221;),
where the result of the function is dependent on the n-1 value
calculated by the function until n equals 0. The first <code>for</code> loop over
the items that we want to permute (the nucleotides) and the second <code>for</code>
recursively calls <code>permutations starting with the initial n</code> passed (10)
until we reach 0. Debugging this function we will see that <code>i</code> is
constant for each iteration of the second loop and only <code>n</code> changes from
10 to 0, while one by one nucleotides are joined to form a motif. It
starts with <code>AAAAAAAAAA</code>, then <code>AAAAAAAAAC</code>, then <code>AAAAAAAAAG</code>, until it gets
to a poly-T. Our final code would look like the one below</p>

<p>where
we read the input sequence(s), merge them in one long string and as we
generate all possible combinations we count the number of times they
appear. This code running on the same input file used on the C++
executable is 60 times slower, taking in average one full minute to
count motifs in 8 500 bp DNA sequences. The slowest section is the
count, as the generation of all possible combinations is
straightforward. We lose some speed, but gain a lot on code simplicity
and clarity. Next we will modify this code to output different counts
needed for the statistical analysis.</p>

<p>The code also uses the <code>itertools</code> module, importing
<code>chains</code> and <code>groupby</code>. We already saw chains in the previous post, but
<code>groupby</code> is new to us here. <code>groupby</code> was introduced in the 2.4 version
of Python and is a method returns keys and groups from an <code>iterable</code>. An
Python <code>iterable</code> is any object that can return its elements at given
time, for instance in a <code>for</code> loop, while the index of this loop is the
<code>iterator</code>. So, in our case <code>groupby</code> will return the sequence names
based on the <code>lambda</code> function defined before the <code>groupby</code> and the
<code>chain</code> method. Usually <code>groupby</code> has this syntax</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">groupby</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">iterable</span><span class="p">[,</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The key is
optional, and in our case it is the lambda function. Another method new
to use that uses the same lambda function is <code>sorted</code>. As its name
hints, <code>sorted</code> returns a sorted list of iterables. The key in this case
is the sorting algorithm, that actually creates the comparison between
items. Basically in the code above, a lambda function extracts the
desired regions from the sequence names, which are them iterated in a
<code>groupby</code> method that returns they key values, one value when the sequence
is unique, two values when there are two sequences, of a sorted iterable
generated by a chain that read both input lists in one pass. After this
we just need to check the number of returned values and we have our list
of matching sequences.</p>

<p>Basically, his approach is to create two dictionaries, <code>first</code> and
<code>second</code> to store the data from our lists of
<a href="http://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/" title="FASTA">FASTA</a> objects. The
dictionaries keys are the sections for each sequence name, and the values
are the FASTA object created when we read the file. After that, a <code>set</code>
of both dictionaries is created, and this represents everything we need
in order to find shared sequences between both files. The output is
trivial, basically iterating the set and getting the values from both
dictionaries. But, in some cases there are some duplicates in each Pfam
alignment, and this would make the above approach to miss some
sequences. Luke also provided a solution for this case</p>

<p>which
is similar to what Mike suggested. In his approach <code>defaultdict</code> is used
instead of a regular dict, initialized as a list. Again we can take
advantage of the fact that we that the value of <code>defaultdict</code> has the
same features as the object that was used to initialized it. The same
<code>set</code> approach is used and we have a nice set of merged sequences from
two Pfam alignments. Remember that <code>defaultdict</code> were introduced in Python
2.5, it won&#8217;t work on older versions.</p>

a considerable improvement to script. But following our line of thought
here, there were many things in both posts that we haven&#8217;t covered in

<p>Mike&#8217;s code would only run on Python 2.5, due to the
import of <code>collections</code>. He imports only <code>defaultdict</code> from collections,
which is similar to a regular dictionary except for the fact that is
takes an extra argument, a <code>factory function</code> (that we will examine
soon), and this <code>factory function</code> is called every time a <code>dict</code> key is
found for the the first time, initializing the object. The line</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">defaultdict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>creates and intializes a <code>defaultdict</code> from an empty list. This
defaultdict is used to store data from a <code>chain</code> formed by both input
files being compared. A <code>chain</code> makes an iterator that &#8220;returns elements
from the first iterable until it is exhausted, the proceeds to the next
iterable&#8221; (from Python docs). Basically a <code>chain</code> in our case will make
the loop iterate first through <code>data1</code> until its last item then will
start the iteration through <code>data2</code>. In the loop it will use the region
in the FASTA sequence name as a defaultdict key, and store the fasta
name and sequence as the value. Notice that the defaultdict, as it has
been initialized as a list, allows appending more than one value to each
key, so every time that it finds a sequence with a name identical to
some key already present in the defaultdict, it will append the
information to the value of that key in a list.</p>

<p>So, all the matching is
done with this short loop, we only need then to iterate through the keys
and print the result. For the results, Mike set up a format string (we
will see in a future post) that receives the merged sequences and their
names in a formatted way. The iteration along the defaultdict checks for
both keys and values and every time it finds a value with a length of 2
(meaning two sequences shared identical names) it puts the items of the
defaultdict&#8217;s value list into two tuples. These tuples, containing
sequence and name, are then formatted for output and appended to a list
of merged sequences.</p>

<p>There are a lot of new concepts, objects and
methods but Mike&#8217;s suggestion shows how powerful Python is. For a set of
25 alignments, there is little performance improvement, but our coding
ability improves exponentially with clever suggestions. I will comment
and explain Luke&#8217;s comments later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mike and Luke left comments and suggestions on how to attack the problem
from the previous entry. I copied their comments here in order to
maintain code formatting a little bit better (comments do not have code
highlighting and formatting). Mike: Why not build a dictionary of the
fasta data keyed by protein ID. The value of each dictionary entry would
be a list of (name,sequence) tuples. Then iterate over the dictionary
items and build the output list from dictionary entries of length == 2.
Obviously, I don’t have any data sets to test it on, but something like
this might work:</p>

<p>Luke: Are there duplicate IDs in a single
file? If not, no reason to perform the intersection twice (once by set,
once by nested loop). Sets and dictionaries are both hashes, so just
remember the instances with the id:</p>

<p>If there are duplicate IDs in a file, and you want the behaviour of your
original script of giving every combination <em>between</em> files, how about
a dictionary of lists and the cross-product of j &amp; k? (I’m going to use
python2.5’s <code>collections.defaultdict</code>, if you’re on an earlier version use
.<code>setdefault</code> . The cross product brings back a nested loop, but it’s only
over values we want rather than the whole datasets.)</p>

<p>And
if you want combinations from within a file as well, just use one
dictionary of lists and cross each list value with itself, excluding
identical elements:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">cross</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To your
question of more directly creating the sets of names, can’t be much more
direct, but perhaps more concise using a generator (or list, with the
extra cost) comprehension:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">myset1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="err">…</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">data1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Could do equivalently for the
dict-based first example above, noting that the dict() constructor can
take a sequence of (key, value) tuples. This would not work for the
<code>defaultdict</code> or <code>setdefault</code> based version.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A colleague came with a &#8220;problem&#8221;: what would be the most efficient way
to merge <a href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/">Pfam</a> alignments? He had FASTA
files containing sequences and he wanted to find identical IDs in two
files and merge the related sequences from different domains of the same
protein. His C++ approach was taking too long to run so I jumped in to
help with some Python tricks.</p>

<p>Fasta headers of Pfam alignments look like
this <code>&gt;P00526.2|SRC_RSVP/147-229</code> where the first section, before the
pipe, is the protein family, the section between the pipe and the slash
is the protein ID and the after the slash are the start and end
positions. Basically we want to match the protein ID, between | and /,
which is the only section that should not change from one alignment from
the other, if there are similar sequences in both files. His dataset
size was around 8000 FASTA files and he wanted to compare
all-versus-all.</p>

<p>The first idea that comes to mind is to read the two
files and basically run nested loops checking for matches between two
sequence names. Simple and easy. But it would be good to find something
else to do in the meantime, instead of checking for its progress.
Another idea, to simplify the process, is to read both files, extract
the protein IDs and check for the intersection of the two sets of IDs
and then just extract the sequences from a list of matches.</p>

<p>This
is the function that matches the sequence IDs. As we are reading the
FASTA file with the functions/classes in the <code>fasta</code> module there is
no* direct way to transform the list of sequence names into a set, that
would make easier to extract the intersection between two sets of IDs
from distinct files. In the above function, <code>data1</code> and <code>data2</code> are
instances of the <code>fasta</code> class, and we read these lists and add the
<code>fasta.name</code> to a couple of sets and get the intersection of them. The
<code>intersection</code> method returns a list that we use in the nested loops to
find the matching sequences, as we need to merge them, we add both names
and residues. Simple and easy. All merged sequences, and their
respective merged names, are appended to a list that is returned at the
end of the function. *<em>if there is a more direct way, just let me know</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last time we saw how to use a set intersection to check for clusters of
DNA/protein sequences and their genome intersections. We going to use
the same example but this time we will see how we can change it and
create a function that would calculate an arbitrary number of
intersections at a time and also be able to check the intersection of
more than two sets. Our previous code to calculate intersections was</p>

<p>and that&#8217;s does not gives us the most important
piece of information: the intersection of A, B and C. Let&#8217;s see how we
can do it. Python has a function that can help us this time: <code>reduce</code>.
This function allows to reduce a series of values to a single one, by
employing a function defined in its parameters. From the file tutorial</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="nb">reduce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">function</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">iterable</span><span class="p">[,</span><span class="n">initializer</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Basically <code>reduce</code> will make the function
modify the values of a iterable (i.e. list). In our case <code>reduce</code> helps
us calculate the intersection of many sets at once (our sets are <code>genA</code>,
<code>genB</code> and <code>genC</code>)</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="nb">reduce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Set</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">intersection</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">genA</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">genB</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">genC</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p> where <code>reduce</code> is applying the <code>Set</code> method
intersection to a list of sets passed to the function. Python&#8217;s <code>reduce</code>
might not be available in 3.0, but it is worth knowing. Now that we have
a Pythonic way of checking the intersections we need to put <code>reduce</code> in
a function, to make our code more elegant.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_intersection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_set1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">my_set2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">my_set3</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">reduce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Set</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">intersection</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">my_set1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">my_set2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">my_set3</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Done. In this function <code>reduce</code> will operate by
first checking the intersection between <code>my_set1</code> and <code>my_set2</code> and
storing it internally, then checking for the intersection between the
previous result and <code>my_set3</code>. But wait &#8230; <code>get_intersection</code> receives
three arguments, so it will be able to return the intersection only when
three sets are sent, thus we would have to create another function that
can receive two items in order to calculate the intersection between two
items. And if we have more than three genomes to compare &#8230; There is a
<a href="http://farmdev.com/thoughts/24/what-does-the-def-star-variable-or-def-asterisk-parameter-syntax-do-in-python-/">trick</a>.
If we define our function receiving only one argument and put a
star/asterisk on it, this means that an arbitrary number of arguments
will be provided to this function in a tuple (and a tuple is iterable,
so it can be used in a reduce). Changing our function accordingly, we
will have</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_intersection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">my_sets</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">reduce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Set</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">intersection</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">my_sets</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>so we can send 2, 3, 4, 5 or <em>n</em> number of sets
to this function and it will return the intersection among all of them.
Our simple script would be (including the above function)</p>
