  <div class="entry-content"><p>About a year ago I purchased <a href="http://www.zennaware.com/">Zennaware</a>&#8217;s Cornerstone, a SVN client for Macs. It&#8217;s a nice application, works really well, it does what it is supposed to do, But as any software is has bugs and problems, and after paying around 50 bucks for a license, one expects that at least one email asking how perform one thing with the software would be answered. It has been more than three weeks that I sent an email to their support team in order to know how to delete some failed repositories from a list, still nothing.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I don&#8217;t know why I pay for software.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I made a 5 book order at Amazon and one of them was
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059615450X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=genedrift-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=059615450X">Bioinformatics Programming Using Python: Practical Programming for
Biological Data (Animal
Guide)</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=genedrift-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=059615450X" alt="image" />
by Mitchell L Model. I started reading the book late Friday night, and
I&#8217;m on the third chapter, where there&#8217;s an introduction to sequences. So
far, I found the book very confusing, especially as it claims to be a
book for people with no programming background. The examples are OK, but
there&#8217;s a very messy mixture of Python interpreter and standalone script
usage, as the author jumps back and forth them. Another thing is that
some examples are explained in detail including the line number, while
others you depend on the code&#8217;s docstring to understand it. So far, I&#8217;m
not impressed. The initial Python sequence example is a set and in this
chapter there already are some functional programming concepts, what can
be quite challenging to someone that has never programmed in their life.
And in the second chapter the reader sees a ternary operator. Another
criticism, is that in the preface the author suggests using Python 3,
instead of 2, what might add to the frustration of the beginner when a
module cannot be installed. I will continue reading it and post whenever
I have a more complete overview of the book.</p>

by Sebastian Bassi. It&#8217;s long overdue, but the delay allowed me to get
more acquainted to the book and its contents. I can only say that I
highly recommend this book, especially for the biologist that is
beginning in bioinformatics or python (or both). I cannot compare it to
any other Python and Bioinformatics books (I&#8217;m planning to buy the
another one), but I can say that I could learn a thing or two from
Sebastian&#8217;s book. Evidently is not a perfect book, as some of the
explanations are a little bit rushed and might be difficult for a
beginner. At the same time this is a very carefully thought and planned
book and has more than enough for one to learn Python and apply the
language to solve biological problems. I really liked the BioPython
section, and this section made me use BioPython for the first time. Some
of BioPython&#8217;s examples in the book are light years ahead of the
examples in the tool&#8217;s website. Lastly, I would like to congratulate
Sebastian for his work and effort in putting together a nice tome for
Python and Bioinformatics. It&#8217;s a valuable resource for everyone in the
field and certainly will help spread Python in the community.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of days ago I posted on my Python/Bioinformatics an entry called &#8217;<a href="http://python.genedrift.org/2010/04/08/the-sickest-python-code-ive-ever-created-1/">The &#8220;sickest&#8221; Python code I&#8217;ve ever created</a>&#8217;. It&#8217;s a code that does some file management for proteomics data, with a different set of inputs each time you run it.</p>

<p>The &#8220;sickest&#8221; part of the title is that it was a small challenge to me. I&#8217;ve been away of actual hard-core coding for quite sometime, and you lose some of the gist of the thing with time. Mostly, nowadays, I make simple scripts that don&#8217;t require any kind of advanced skills (in any language) and I don&#8217;t worry that much of releasing code or about ultra fast performance. I knew from the time I posted that a lot of people would jump and help and teach me, as I was aware it wasn&#8217;t the most elegant code out there, not even the most Pythonic one too. What also helped me is that my Python/Bioinformatics blog is indexed on Planet Python, and the audience is far more hard-core Python that I ever dreamed of getting by myself alone.</p>

<p>But the real deal is that I believe it would be much more difficult for me to get some positive feedback or even an answer if I had posted bits of my code on a online forum or community or list. Every time I used one of these methods, I either got no answer, or got schooled for not posting in the right format or somebody replied that no one knew how to do it. There&#8217;s the real deal of blogging, and the value is even higher if your audience knows more than you do. I appreciate every comment I got on that post and on others too, I learned things that I wasn&#8217;t able to learn from computer books and online tutorials (yes, I searched sometimes before reading the comments, and sometimes after).</p>
