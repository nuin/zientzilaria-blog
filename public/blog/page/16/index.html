  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been putting my Vista machine to sleep (I know wrong verb tense, but it&#8217;s being put to sleep slowly), so I&#8217;m transferring some files from it to my main machine at the moment, and some of these files were fonts that work in either system. I had about 1000 free fonts and decided to put install them on my iMac. Of course, something broke and Thunderbird and iTunes started to display text in a cuneiform (or cuneiform-ish) font. So, as a good computer guy I have my system backed up my TimeMachine and I restored the</p>

<p>/Library/Font</p>

<p>directory just in case a font was installed over some system font. I used a backup copy of the dir a couple of months old, rebooted the system and voil√†! the cuneiform font was still there. Then, I decided to dig deeper, and I searched for how to restore the fonts on Leopard. The less aggressive way I found was to reinstall it. Thanks but no thanks, I thought. Then I decided to dig even deeper (it was getting hot) and I decided to search for the culprit fonts. It wasn&#8217;t easy among thousands of fonts, so I called spotlight to help me, and searched initially for anything called &#8220;fonts&#8221; and to my surprise there are two Fonts directories</p>

<p>/Library/Fonts
/>/Library/Fonts</p>

<p>Checking both, I discovered that the new installed fonts were in the latter and it was also taking precedence over the main system dir. Nice, this makes things even easier, as I just need to remove the fonts from //Library/Fonts and problem solved. And it was!</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I may be dumb (most of the cases you are right) and I also might no read manuals and not have a large knowledge of systems, so if you are the I&#8217;m-always-right-and-know-everything-guy from the interwebs, good for you and you shouldn&#8217;t be reading this anyway. It worked for me so you mileage may vary.Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/fonts">fonts</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/os%20x">os x</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/restoring%20system">restoring system</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And we&#8217;re back to check our initial scripts to run on Python 3.0. Along
with this latest release, a nice tool to parse your scripts is also
installed. It&#8217;s called
<a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/library/2to3.html">2to3</a> and it&#8217;s
available in the <code>Tools/scripts</code> of your Python 3.o installation
directory. Basic usage is very similar to any python script: [sourcecode
language=&#8217;bash&#8217;]2to3 end. This will tell Python what we want the end of
the line, in our case an empty string. So the line would be [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]print(line, end = &#8221;)[/sourcecode] That&#8217;s it. So
code_03 and code_04 will be [sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]#code_03
import re #setting the DNA string myDNA = &#8216;ACGTTGCAACGTTGCAACGTTGCA&#8217;
#assigning a new regex and compiling it #to find all Ts regexp =
re.compile(&#8216;T&#8217;) #create a new string tha will receive #the regex
result with Us replacing Ts myRNA = regexp.sub(&#8216;U&#8217;, myDNA) print(myRNA)
#end 03 #code 04 #assigning a filename to a variable dnafile =
&#8220;AY162388.seq&#8221; #opening the file file = open(dnafile, &#8216;r&#8217;) #printing
each line of the file for line in file: print(line, end=&#8221;&#8220;)[/sourcecode]
Now, code_05, has 45 lines including comments, so it should be a good
idea to test 2to3 on it, especially after a long time since we created
the script. There might be some other changes that we might miss (I
already . Let&#8217;s run 2to3 on our original script and check the output:
<code>RefactoringTool: Skipping implicit fixer: buffer RefactoringTool: Skipping implicit fixer: idioms RefactoringTool: Skipping implicit fixer: set_literal RefactoringTool: Skipping implicit fixer: ws_comma --- code_05.py (original) +++ code_05.py (refactored) @@ -30,16 +30,16 @@  #the loop continues  while inputfromuser:      #raw_input received the user input as string -    inmotif = raw_input('Enter motif to search: ') +    inmotif = input('Enter motif to search: ')      #now we check for the size of the input      if len(inmotif) &gt;= 1:          #we compile a regex with the input given          motif = re.compile('%s' % inmotif)          #looking to see if the entered motif is in the sequence          if re.search(motif, sequence): -            print 'Yep, I found it' +            print('Yep, I found it')          else: -            print 'Sorry, try another one' +            print('Sorry, try another one')      else: -        print 'Done, thanks for using motif_search' +        print('Done, thanks for using motif_search')          inputfromuser = False RefactoringTool: Files that need to be modified: RefactoringTool: code_05.py</code>
So a lot of lines, seems that we need to do a lot of changes. But in
fact there are not many changes. All lines starting with a - need to be
removed and replaced by the lines starting with a +, and the + lines are
adjacent to the ones we need to change. Again, the most common changes
here are the print statements, but there is also another change to be
done [sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]inmotif = raw_input(&#8216;Enter motif to
search: &#8216;) inmotif = input(&#8216;Enter motif to search: &#8216;)[/sourcecode] So,
there is no <code>raw_input</code> in Python 3.0, it was abolished for a more
evolved <code>input</code> function that now always expect a string, that can be
evaluated later if needed (and desired), just like the old <code>raw_input</code>.
Now there is no confusion anymore on which one to use. Digging a little
bit into 2to3 we see that it can write the code for use by using the
<code>-w</code> parameter when running the script. Be careful as it rewrites the
same file, however saving a backup copy. In the end we get this code
from 2to3 (code_05.py) [sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]#!/usr/bin/env
python &#8221;&#8217; simple script to find motifs on DNA sequences using regex the
script is interactive &#8221;&#8217; # we use the RegEx module import re import
string #still keep the file fixed dnafile = &#8220;AY162388.seq&#8221; #opening
the file, reading the sequence and storing in a list seqlist =
open(dnafile, &#8216;r&#8217;).readlines() #let&#8217;s join the the lines in a temporary
string temp = &#8221;.join(seqlist) #assigning our sequence, with no
carriage returns to our #final variable/object sequence =
temp.replace(&#8216;\n&#8217;, &#8221;) #we start to deal with user input #first we
use a boolean variable to check for valid input inputfromuser = True
#while loop: while there is an motif larger than 0 #the loop continues
while inputfromuser: #raw_input received the user input as string
inmotif = input(&#8216;Enter motif to search: &#8216;) #now we check for the size
of the input if len(inmotif) >= 1: #we compile a regex with the input
given motif = re.compile(&#8216;%s&#8217; % inmotif) #looking to see if the entered
motif is in the sequence if re.search(motif, sequence): print(&#8216;Yep, I
found it&#8217;) else: print(&#8216;Sorry, try another one&#8217;) else: print(&#8216;Done,
thanks for using motif_search&#8217;) inputfromuser = False[/sourcecode] 2to3
seems to be pretty good in detecting changes, pointing them to you and
even writing the newer script for you. Until now I haven&#8217;t tested on big
scripts (more than 100 lines long), but I plan to do it soon. For small
scripts we saw that it works quite well. A good test for 2to3 would be
when we get to the motifs scripts that are a little bit more complex,
even though they are quite short. Stay tuned and check new code on the
repository.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, Python 3.0 was released earlier than Perl &#8230; what version was it?
6? 7? Anyway, I decided to go back to most of the scripts that were
posted here. In the github repo we have 50 files in the &#8220;original
scripts&#8221; directory. Let&#8217;s check how do they fare on Python 3.0 and what
type of changes we need to do in order to make them work. Starting with
code_01.py, which is a couple of lines long [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]myDNA = &#8220;ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT&#8221; print
myDNA[/sourcecode] Here we have one of the most evident differences
between Python 2.x and 3.0. Now <code>print</code> is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#print-is-a-function">function not a statement
anymore</a>,
so whatever we want to print now should be passed as a function
parameter. The above code would be changed to [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]myDNA = &#8220;ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT&#8221;
print(myDNA)[/sourcecode] That simple ins this case. But what are the
advantages of <code>print</code> being a function over a statement? More
flexibility, as can be seen in the link above. It is possible now to
send different parameters to print and make the output richer by
customizing separators between items, directing the output, etc. A
similar change would have to be made n our code_02.py. There are two
<code>print</code> statements there that should be translated to the function.
Trivial, so far. The original code [sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]myDNA =
&#8220;ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT&#8221; myDNA2 = &#8220;TCGATCGATCGATCGATCGA&#8221; print &#8220;First
and Second sequences&#8221; print myDNA, myDNA2 myDNA3 = myDNA + myDNA2 print
&#8220;Concatenated sequence&#8221; print myDNA3[/sourcecode] and to work on Python
3 [sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]myDNA = &#8220;ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT&#8221;
myDNA2 = &#8220;TCGATCGATCGATCGATCGA&#8221; print(&#8220;First and Second sequences&#8221;)
print(myDNA, myDNA2) myDNA3 = myDNA + myDNA2 print(&#8220;Concatenated
sequence&#8221;) print(myDNA3)[/sourcecode] This is would be the biggest (or
at least the most common) change that we would need to make in the
scripts posted here. Follow the repo to get the newer versions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this second (maybe third) post on why I think Open Science/Research won&#8217;t work, at least for now, I&#8217;ll try to tell a story of something that happened in the (argh!) blogosphere. This is a real story but I will leave the real names out of it.</p>

<p>It all started in on prominent blog of a prominent Open Scientist/Researcher. S/he used to write about papers, data, grants and small problems s/he would encounter along the way. People would pitch in, give some advice, and life and research would go on its natural path. Open Science/Research was working great!! and everyone was benefiting from it. And the sky was blue and birds were singing.</p>

<p>One day he or she comes with a software problem. Someone in the lab was writing a piece of code in some prominent computer language and there was a problem with the calculations. Great!! time to call the community!! Open Science/Research to the rescue! I saw some people pitching in &#8220;this might be wrong, that might be faulty&#8221;, everyone contributing to the betterment of science. But wait: how do you know where to fix the code, if there is no code?</p>

<p>It was then that I started thinking, if this is Open Science/Research and this a prominent member of such &#8220;community&#8221; why doesn&#8217;t he or she use some kind of open source repository or give away the code in the blog? It would be much easier to fix it, try it, experiment with it if the code is there, openly available. After a couple of posts and some comments asking for the code, he or she made available the buggy section. And the problem was solved. But I don&#8217;t remember seeing the whole code there.</p>

<p>Os if it&#8217;s open why not everything is open? If you are a prominent blogger/researcher for the open science, why don&#8217;t you know what open science/research preaches? I&#8217;m guessing that the person doesn&#8217;t know the basic foundation of the &#8220;field&#8221;, or maybe she or he couldn&#8217;t open the code because someone that is not &#8220;into&#8221; the openness is doing the code &#8230; I can go on and on trying to draw scenarios, but those would be only conjectures.</p>

<p>So until a good part of science is not open or there is more understanding of what is Open Science/Research is, even by the proponents, it won&#8217;t work. How to change that? I don&#8217;t know, you might.Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/open%20science">open science</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/won%27t%20work">won&#8217;t work</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I rarely write about myself around here (or anywhere else), so once in a while it&#8217;s good to do so. The extra-credit part of the Scientific Blog Meme, asked if one was able to write about his/her research. Well, mine was posted yesterday.</p>

<p>You may not know, but when I was really young I always wanted to be a book writer, and when I was 16, 17, I started writing (bad) poetry, but ended up never developing it, after life threw some bad things at me.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for the 25 brave souls that read it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We can say that this would be our final version of the script. There are
many nice wxPython programming resources, and one is a very good book
called <a href="http://manning.com/rappin/">wxPython in Action</a>, which is
co-written by Robin Dunn, the wxPython maintainer. Go check it out. So
for the last entry in this series, we just need to add a couple of
changes to our interface and motif finding scripts. Basically on the
interface script we need to add a line that gets the value entered (or
the default one, if not changed) in the motif width input box. And we
can do that by including the line below in the <code>run_finder</code> function.
[sourcecode language=&#8217;python&#8217;]width =
self.motif_width.GetValue()[/sourcecode] This line tells the script to
get the value of the box and assign to the variable width. This method
will get whatever is inside the input box and save as a string to the
variable assigned. Now, we need to create the structure to actually send
this value to the motif finder functions. Last version of our function
<code>calculate_motifs</code> received two parameters, we need to add an extra one,
and also change the lines that call the function that get the quorums.
Basically the first lines of the function will be [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]def calculate_motifs(input_seqs, input_seqs2,
width): print input_seqs, input_seqs2 input_seqs =
fasta.read_seqs(open(input_seqs).readlines()) input_seqs2 =
fasta.read_seqs(open(input_seqs2).readlines()) foreground =
get_quorums(input_seqs, width) background = get_quorums(input_seqs2,
width)[/sourcecode] And that&#8217;s it. Our simple interface is ready to
primetime. OK, not prime primetime, we didn&#8217;t add a series of features
that will make it useful by everyone. For instance, there is no error
control, so someone could enter &#8216;ABC&#8217; in the width input box and that
value would be sent and an error will occur. Also you can click the run
button without any file selected. And we could go on and on. But this is
just a primer, and we can build from it. The code is on
<a href="http://github.com/nuin/beginning-python-for-bioinformatics/tree/master/scripts/motifs">Github</a>,
so get it there and have fun. Next time we will see &#8230; no plans yet.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We need to pause a bit and do some corrections on our code. First the
code I posted on the last entry for the pymotif.py module is wrong. Ok,
not wrong, but some of the code I use to test ended up on the blog. Ths
first two lines of the calculate_motifs function contained a link to
the files I use for testing and should be replaced by [sourcecode
language=&#8217;python&#8217;]input_seqs =
fasta.read_seqs(open(input_seqs).readlines()) input_seqs2 =
fasta.read_seqs(open(input_seqs2).readlines())[/sourcecode] Also both
variables that store the filenames and paths in pymoteGUI.py are
declared in the wrong scope. The should have be declared at the pymotGUI
class level, so it is accessible to all the functions in that class.
This also means that every time we access the variable it should be
preceded by the class name in order for the interpreter to know where
the to get the value from. So both corrected files would be [sourcecode
