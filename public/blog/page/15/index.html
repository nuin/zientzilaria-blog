  <div class="entry-content"><p>The chapter 3 review that I promised for &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; (last Saturday) was
lazily postponed until today. So, let&#8217;s get to it. Tarek in this chapter
continues with syntax best practices, but at this time at class level.
As expected the chapter requires that you have a minimal knowledge of
Python classes, so I can say it&#8217;s geared to somewhat experienced
programmers, and not to newcomers. There is a short explanation on
sub-classing that warms up things for the next sections. Next is the
built-in method (type?) <code>super</code>, which was new to me. Basically <code>super</code>
gives you access a method or attribute of a class by calling its parent
directly. This is a segue into understanding the Method Resolution Order
in Python, which is understanding which class has precedence over the
others. For me, I haven&#8217;t dealt with such structures before it was a
good and straight explanation, especially when he explains about
possible pitfalls of using <code>super</code>. A short list of best practices
helps:</p>

<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Multiple inheritance should be avoided:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>super usage has to be consistent: Mixing super and classic calls is
a confusing practice.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t mix old-style and new-style classes</li>
<li>Class hierarchy has to be looked over when a parent class is called</li>
</ul>


<p>After dealing with MRO, comes what I think is one of the best sections
of the book so far, where Tarek explains about object descriptors and
gives a little bit of the Python&#8217;s approach to introspection. This short
section is basically all code, but it&#8217;s good to have a good best
practices reference, including here properties and slots. The last part
of the chapter covers meta programming, and as Chris pointed in the
comments, that&#8217;s a difficult area of Python (maybe for the ones like me
that don&#8217;t have a CS formation). I would have to try the examples by
hand and maybe define areas in my code where I can use it, so to take
fully advantage and fully understand it. Overall, the chapter gives a
good series of topics about Python classes and I enjoyed learning a
little bit more things that I couldn&#8217;t understand previously. Next we
will see a review of chapter 4, that deals with PEP 8 and naming best
practices.</p>

<pre><code>Image via [Wikipedia](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Metallic_MaRS.jpg)
</code></pre>

<p>In my humble opinion, <a href="http://mndoci.com">Deepak</a>&#8217;s latest posts lacked a little bit of whatever his posts had in the past. First he comes with the original idea that <a href="http://mndoci.com/blog/2009/01/31/funding-science-its-important/">funding science is important</a>. Then he claims that if you don&#8217;t want to stay in academia, you should <a href="http://mndoci.com/blog/2009/02/02/join-a-startup/">join a startup</a> or start one.</p>

<p>I agree with both his posts. But this is not what I want from Deepak, I want more and these don&#8217;t deliver. It&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m (or half of me) in academia that I think science funding is important. Science funding is important in any aspect of life, and it&#8217;ll always be. That&#8217;s what drives the economy of a country, innovation, and innovation comes from science, either in academia or in industry. But, I&#8217;m not here to write about funding. I want to write about joining a startup, and I have two stories to tell.</p>

<p>The first one is personal the second not so much. Early in 2004 I decided to look for a job in a company. I was a little bit frustrated with my scientific results and I might have realized at the time that academic life was not for me. I tried searching companies in Canada and Europe, and didn&#8217;t have much luck in either place. But a couple of months after I started searching, I found a nice startup in Europe with a fancy website (for the time) and what looked like a promising future. At least from what I saw on the website, they had some money from the government of such country to use on bioinformatics research. I contacted the person responsible for the company and had a great reception, and we exchanged a good number of emails for more than an year, trying to find ways to find moeny so I can spend some time at the company and see if we connected. I had at the time an impression that company, even though being only a small startup, was solid and they were planning for a bright future. Then later in 2005 I found the opportunity to meet with the owner of the company. There was a conference in Europe and I was awarded a travel grant, which would cover 1/3 of the costs of going there. Everything was set with the person and we were to meet at the conference.</p>

<p>When I got there, I searched and searched for the person. Then I remembered that a couple of months before he would be doing some kind of internship at one of the best European&#8217;s bioinformatics institutes. I asked around and learned that he was a lab X at such institute and he wouldn&#8217;t come to the conference due to some &#8220;last minute problems&#8221;. OK, I thought, wait and see. I wrote a polite email when I got back, and ceased any type of correspondence with such person. Early in 2006, I learned that he closed the company and accepted a position in another institute. And much later he found a position in another company.</p>

<p>Lessons? Yes, at least one, or maybe many. Joining a startup is risky, and will give you less stability than joining a big company, like Amazon. Don&#8217;t trust everyone in a startup (as you shouldn&#8217;t trust everyone in a  big company) even if they have governmental funding. Joining a startup will give more intellectual flexibility, that&#8217;s a a give, but you have to calculate if that&#8217;s a pro or a con. As anything in life there&#8217;s two sides (or multiple), and this has to be a well thought decision, to avoid being lured by promises and frustrated with no delivery.</p>

<p>The other story comes from a lecture I watched a couple of years ago. The lab I was working at the time moved to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaRS_Discovery_District">MaRS</a> complex in downtown Toronto. MaRS is also an incubator and to foster new entrepreneurship, and one of the activities is an 101 seminar series. One of the seminars was what were the difficulties oof creating a startup in clinical/medical research. I remember the slides of this woman and each company she had created and sold after a couple of years. She gave the name of at least eight companies there had been absorbed by large companies, which were then absorbed by even larger companies. And she talked about this for more than an hour. Lesson? You can get very lucky if the startup you&#8217;re in gets bought by a larger company. But remember, large companies might not be interested in you, or you might not be long enough in the startup to receive any dividends of the incorporation. As in the previous story, be careful and check everything before accepting anything.</p>

<p>So, these were my stories with startups. A final lesson: if advice were good, people would sell it, not publish for free on the internet. Use the two cents I gave you the best you can.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>So we&#8217;re up to the second chapter of Tarek&#8217;s book. A short disclaimer
before diving into it. I started this blog, basically one year after I
had started programming with Python. The initial idea was to &#8220;convert&#8221;
the Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics book to Python and see what were
the advantages and disadvantages of both languages. I was far from being
a advanced Python programmer, and the inception of the blog helped me
getting close to that, even though I consider myself far from being an
expert programmer in Python. I learned a lot working on converting the
Perl and learned a lot from the comments and interaction with other
programmers and visitors of the blog. As anything in life one&#8217;s path is
long and tortuous and there&#8217;s nothing better than daily learning and
exercise. So, as I mentioned in the previous post, this book was
tailored for someone like me. I needed a boost on advanced Python
techniques and the second chapter just gave me that. Tarek writes in
this chapter about good syntax practices below the class level,
functions and methods that are common in daily usage. He starts with
list comprehensions, that we have seen in this site. It&#8217;s a short and
concise section and gives you exactly what you need about this
functionality. Next, iterators and generators. I had a little bit of
background on iterators, and have used them here and there, but not a
lot on generators. I learned a bit from this section, what you expect
from a book like this, things like the <code>close</code> and <code>throw</code>. Although
this was good first step on generators, I wished the section could be
longer, but that maybe not the focus of the book. Coroutines was a
completely new subject for me. Maybe I haven&#8217;t been diving into Python
as much as I needed to, but time is short these days and programming
Python is not the first objective of my work. The example is complete
and easy to understand, but again I wish it was a tad bit longer. Tarek
then explains a bit of generator expressions (list comprehension for
generators) and enters the itertools module. So far so good, it&#8217;s a nice
summary (at least for me) of simple techniques that can be incorporated
into daily coding. And then &#8230; Decorators. I blame on my poor CS skills
or maybe my whole background on programming, but I still cannot get
decorators. In my short-sighted view of the programming world I cannot
see a place, at least on the things I&#8217;m doing, where I can use a
decorator. And here comes the first criticism of the book: I still
cannot get after reading the section. One thing that would help a bit
would be to have colours on the examples and maybe go over them
explaining some code lines. But at the same time, I admit that this
might be a personal problem, where the concept of decorators don&#8217;t fit
into my brain, and maybe the focus of the book is to show this advanced
technique to someone that has a better grasp of the concept. Overall,
it&#8217;s a very good chapter and a good pointer to some expert/advanced
techniques in Python. Tomorrow, chapter 3, and we&#8217;re a going to see
classes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve bought (no, Packt Publishing didn&#8217;t send me a copy for review)
Tarek&#8217;s book quite sometime ago, but job changes, and extra-Python
issues kept me away from reading it with the attention if fully deserve.
When I saw the announcement, I thought that this was the book I wanted
in Python. First, a little bit of perspective. I&#8217;m a a biologist,
self-taught programmer/coder/you-name-it. I only had a brief course on
programming logic with Pascal in 1993 (I think). I first learned Basic
on Apple ][, then on PC, then moved to Visual Basic, Pascal, C and C++,
most of them with the help of books. About three and a half years ago, I
got tired of compiling things and decided to learn a different language
that would be more agile to code with. Not liking Perl, made me check
Python. And I got hooked. Of course as a lay programmer, I won&#8217;t discuss
why it&#8217;s better or worse than any other language using technical terms,
but I can say that Python fits my needs in fast and efficient
programming and I&#8217;m quite happy with the choice I&#8217;ve made. So, this
review will not be technical, but will try to expose the book&#8217;s
strengths and the weak parts. Chapter one gives a good introduction on
how to install Python and some nice pointers on how to program Python,
such as IDEs and initial settings you can add to it. Also there is a
short overview of the modern Python implementations. Is it a necessary
chapter? Yes and no. No, because the schooled Python user won&#8217;t need it,
his or her programming environment will already be installed,
configured, set and ready to go. Yes, because this chapter works as a
disclaimer for the not-so-experienced Python programmer, and shows
everyone of what is expected of this book and what standards will be
used. In my opinion, it&#8217;s a necessary starting point, so the author
knows that everyone is at the same level. This chapter is also a good
short summary of good practices of installing and setting up Python.
Tomorrow, chapter 2.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, we&#8217;re back! And to the old-new story of why the Open Science movement will fail, at least for now. I was planning to post something on a different note, but a <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/08fefccf-a78a-ec1b-bc25-a77d07dca656/A-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the/">recent discussion thread</a> on FriendFeed called me to post about it.</p>

<p>This thread was started by a <a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2009/01/21/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-forum/">blog entry</a> the poster-boy of the Open Science/Research/Buzz-Word-of-the-moment Movement, <a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/User:Cameron_Neylon">Cameron Neylon</a>.</p>

<p>As most of the &#8220;literature&#8221; you find in his blog, very well written, he uses a metaphor of some mundane human social behaviour/activity trying to captivate the reader and bring him to his &#8220;open&#8221; universe. Sometimes it&#8217;s related to a train commute, sometimes a music or a scientific article. When the the reader is inside his web, BANG! comes the open science mantra, that we have to be open, that we have to prevent the existence of a walled-garden of discussions, that we have to open everyuthing, make it more accessible, etc. At this point, you, the reader, are willing to sell your house or your first born and donate all the money to the Open Science/Research/Buzz-Word-of-the-moment and do whatever he proposes to open more Science and the discussion around science topics.</p>

<p>But, oops!, there&#8217;s a problem, and a big one: there is no proposition, no alternative on how we put down the so-called walled-garden of FriendFeed-limited discussions. What more openness does he need? What is the alternative of posting a comment to his blog, which is somewhat mirrored on FriendFeed? One just need and email and a password to join the discussion on FF, basically the same number of clicks to post a comment on his blog. Both services are indexed in Google, and saved somewhere for posterity. There are some aspects that might prevent someone of participating in the discussion, like not wanting to or not knowing the services.</p>

<p>This line of thinking, where one person uses more than two paragraphs to show how every one else is wrong, but the ingroup, and at the same time no concrete (even imaginary) alternative is proposed resembles the same tactics used by the hard-core cladists. For them, ClustalW is a product of the devil, Maximum Likelihood should not be taught in universities and Apple is the cult of the beast. In the end the hard-core cladists were shunned in a corner and had their research (or at least part of it) tagged with cult status, at least in the scientific circle I exist. (If you are a soft-core cladist, I embrace you).</p>

<p>In one way or another that&#8217;s what will happen to the Open Science/Research/Buzz-Word-of-the-moment Movement, if they keep on producing the same shallow rhetoric and proposing the same weightless, empty, nonexistent alternatives. Serious people that don&#8217;t know about their proposition, one day will notice that in the end they don&#8217;t do nothing at all, much less propose anything that can minimally change the future of scientific research.</p>

<p>And before you beat me and say that I also don&#8217;t propose anything different, you&#8217;re definitely right. But I never announced any intention on doing so, I&#8217;m just a scientist with an opinion. And opinions in our era are free.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my humble opinion (of sorts!) every band, musical group, singer, bad or good, mediocre or excellent have, in one way or another, produced at least one masterpiece (yes, I like commas). This song can be extremely good or just ordinary. If it&#8217;s extremely good it surpasses or rivals other compositions of identical level, if it&#8217;s ordinary, it might be the one and only good (in terms) song that that group created. I have more than 800 CDs, 150 Lps and thousands of music recorded or bought online, and here is my list of masterpieces, so far and in no particular order.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to the 17th edition of the Cancer Research Blog Carnival. This is my first time hosting it and it has been a fun time reading the submissions and learning a little bit what are the new things in cancer research. The subject hasn&#8217;t been present in my blog even though I have close contact with oncologists and cancer researchers. For those that usually stop by, the Cancer Research Blog Carnival is a monthly collection of cancer-related blogging. Personally, I don&#8217;t work directly with Cancer but I have done work that was used in cancer research applications.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s start the new year and check what has been submitted. Enjoy!</p>

<p>First we have a submission from Walter Jessen who presents <a href="http://www.highlighthealth.com/diseases-and-conditions/gene-expression-can-predict-the-survival-of-lymphoma-patients/">Gene Expression Can Predict the Survival of Lymphoma Patients</a> posted at <a href="http://www.highlighthealth.com">Highlight HEALTH</a>. The study deals with the use of DNA microarrays in order to determine expression profiles of genes that influence chemotherapy treatments of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Such profiles can help define the ideal treatment and as Walter points out in the prognosis of the malignancy.</p>

<blockquote><p>This study exemplifies how gene expression can be used as a clinical prognostic factor. Indeed, such studies herald the future of genomic medicine. Specifically for DLBCL, this study suggests that only a subgroup of patients whose tumors are characterized by high relative expression of the stromal-2 signature may benefit from drugs that inhibit angiogenesis.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second link comes from Orna Ross that brings us <a href="http://www.ornaross.com/living-with-cancer/2008/11/good-things-ive-gained-from-having-cancer-2/">Good Things I&#8217;ve Gained from Having Cancer #2</a> posted at <a href="http://www.ornaross.com">Orna Ross</a>. Everyone that has had cancer or have a relative with cancer can relate to the sentiments that Orna writes in her post. Just find the bigger importance to what is really important.</p>

<blockquote><p>I still love plans and to-dos but cancer has heightened my awareness of what I‚Äôve always known.  That everything dies and that, meantime, this is it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Miracle cures? is what Kat Arney presents <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2008/12/03/cancer-cured-for-good-gc-maf-and-the-miracle-cure/">&#8220;Cancer cured for good?&#8221; ‚Äì Gc-MAF and the miracle cure</a> posted at <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org">Cancer Research UK - Science Update</a>. As Kat writes, I really thought that it was too good to be true from the start. The original study reviewed in the post states that injections of Gc <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage_activating_factor">macrophage activating factor</a> (Gc-MAF), what theoretically can induce macrophages to fight cancer. And why don&#8217;t macrophages fighter cancer to begin with? Because Gc-MAF is not naturally produced by the body when some types of tumours are present, as they release the Nagalase (alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase) enzyme.</p>

<blockquote><p>Our conclusioon - it&#8217;s interesting work, but certainly not the &#8220;100% cure&#8221; that is being promoted in some quarters. This post has got a lot of traffic - people are obviously searching for it - but we haven&#8217;t found a considered scientific analysis of the work anywhere else on the web. It&#8217;s also prompted a bit of debate, as you might expect.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our fourth submission of the month is brought by Kevin Beck: <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/the_spontaneous_regression_of_breast_can.php">The spontaneous regression of breast cancer?</a> posted at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/">Respectful Insolence</a>. It&#8217;s a long post, that reviews some interesting findings on breast cancer that may spontaneously regress or increased significantly after a mammography. As any complex disease with many variables involved it&#8217;s quite hard to understand which variables are actually working on keeping the disease alive or killing it. Also it&#8217;s difficult to know how would be the progression of the different tumours and which ones would progress and which ones will regress.</p>

<blockquote><p>Moreover, it is quite possible that a significant proportion of breast cancers detected by mammography (although, I hasten to add, not cancers detected as palpable masses) may indeed regress. The problem is that we do not yet know enough to identify which tumors will progress and which may not.</p></blockquote>

<p>Next, we have a submission from Orac presenting <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bushwells/2008/12/prozac_the_anticancer_drug.php">Dr. Joan Bushwell&#8217;s Chimpanzee Refuge : Prozac, the anti-cancer drug?</a> posted at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bushwells/">Dr. Joan Bushwell&#8217;s Chimpanzee Refuge</a>. This post deals with the prescription of antidepressant drugs to cancer patients. It has been discovered that Prozac can increase the effectiveness of doxorubicin, an anti-cancer agent.</p>

<blockquote><p>In animal models, a mild doxorubicin-fluoxetine treatment combination slowed down tumor progression significantly. These results suggest that pairing Prozac with chemotherapeutic drugs to curb drug resistance warrants further clinical study, says Dr. Peer.</p></blockquote>

<p>Moving on, Alexey Bersenev presents <a href="http://hematopoiesis.info/2008/12/05/cancer-stem-cells-how-mouse-model-can-change-the-concept/">Cancer stem cells - how mouse model can change the concept</a> posted at <a href="http://hematopoiesis.info">Hematopoiesis</a>. This post shows a short review of what has been published and discovered about Cancer Stem Cells and their models for different tumour types. So, are these models useful for all types of cancer or is it a more complex problem? Alexey also brings us <a href="http://hematopoiesis.info/2008/12/28/validity-of-the-cancer-stem-cell-concept-under-discussion/">Validity of the cancer stem cell concept under discussion</a> posted at <a href="http://hematopoiesis.info">Hematopoiesis</a>. Continuing on the cancer stem cell theme, this post gets different opinions and comments of researchers of this controversial topic. It&#8217;s a hot topic and surely getting a lot of steam recently with new research findings and papers published.</p>

<blockquote><p>This week, everyone is talking about cancer stem cells (CSC), everywhere on the web. I wrote about this a half year ago and it has been finally materialized in the paper. Basically the main reason for a new boom is a Nature report from Sean Morrison‚Äôs lab which shows that cancer stem cell concept doesn‚Äôt apply for human melanoma.</p></blockquote>

<p>Last, but not least, Kamel presents <a href="http://bayblab.blogspot.com/2008/12/early-detection-and-cancer-survival.html">Bayblab: Early Detection and Cancer Survival</a> posted at <a href="http://bayblab.blogspot.com/">Bayblab</a>. This entry ponders about a recent Wired magazine article about cancer detection and survival. Is a take on the mainstream media and the (mis)conceptions of some cancer related topics. Should we ban cancer treatment and focus on cancer detection?</p>

<blockquote><p>The article argues, based on cancer survival statistics, that &#8220;scientists should stop trying to cure cancer and start focusing on finding it early.&#8221; The author notes that in the case of ovarian cancer, for example, discovery at stage I or II the 10-year survival rate is almost 90%, while the survival if diagnosis occurs later - at stage III or IV - drops dramatically to 20%.</p></blockquote>

<p>And this is the carnival for the first month of the new year. I would like to thank Walter and the guys at Bayblab (you should contact them at bayblab[at]gmail[dot]com if you want to host) for the opportunity and I hope to host the carnival later in the year.</p>

<p>A last minute announcement from Walter Jessen regarding the new subscription options for the carnival. The Cancer Research Blog Carnival now has subscription options; you can follow by <a href="feed://feedproxy.google.com/CancerResearchBlogCarnival">email or RSS feed</a>. An aggregated feed of credible, rotating health and medicine blog carnivals is also <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/HealthAndMedicineBlogCarnivals">available</a>.</p>

<p>Happy New Year everyone!</p>

Beginning Python for Bioinformatics on December 13th. I would like to
thank everyone that commented, helped with posts and suggested anything
that would make this website better. Clearly it is far from being what I
wanted it to be, but slowly but surely we will get there. Thanks again
