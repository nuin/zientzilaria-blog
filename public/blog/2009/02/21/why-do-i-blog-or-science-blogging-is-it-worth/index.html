<p><em>Mirroring the post that appeared on Blind.Scientist</em> Some time ago
there was a meme about science blogging and one of the questions were
&#8220;why do you blog&#8221;. Well, I do it because of the &#8221;<a href="http://www.nadasurf.com/" title="Nada Surf">Nada
Surf</a> effect&#8221;. You don&#8217;t know the
&#8220;Nada Surf effect&#8221;? Pity you weren&#8217;t in Washington, DC 2001. In March or
April of 2001, Nada Surf played a concert there. It was a small bar on
14th Street W, close to the more famous Black Cat. It was a spring
night, I was with a couple of Dutch friends that had told me about the
concert, if I&#8217;m not wrong, a couple of days before. It was also
mid-week, so you wouldn&#8217;t expect big crowds in most concerts. We left
ISH around 7 pm, with spare time for the 9 pm concert. We didn&#8217;t know
the venue, we got there and it was empty, just a couple of souls at the
bar. We sat and for about an hour we were pondering if we were in the
right place, until a guy came and asked if we were staying for the
concert. We said yes, paid th US$ 7.50 of the admittance and sipped our
beers waiting for the opening act. Soon after we paid, a van parked
outside and some guys started bringing music equipment inside. At that
time there must have been around 20 people there. The van guys set the
instruments, wasted 5 minutes soundchecking, and started. IT was Ashtray
Babyhead. They played for 40 minutes and as fast as they arrived they
left. Another van parked outside and this time Nada Surf members started
unloading and setting up the stage. Now roadies. OK, maybe one guy
helped, but I&#8217;m getting old and the memory sometimes falters. At that
point in time, almost 9 pm, the number of brave souls was at 50. They
played as they were playing for 50.000 people in Wembley. Nice set,
great songs, unforgettable night. After the show, they sold CDs at the
usual after-show gathering, we talked about New York, Brazil and
feijoada. And why do I call it the &#8220;Nada Surf effect&#8221;? A band that used
to play for thousands of people in festivals and stadiums, had a number
one video on MTV (Popular), played in a midweek night in a small bar in
Washington, DC as it was the band farewell. Every fan that night felt
that they were the most important one, maybe even the only one. And this
type of example is the one that brings me to write this, and to write
Beginning Python for Bioinformatics. Especially the latter (as I spend
too much time here, writing about non-important stuff). If I can make
one person have an idea, one person there to use Python, or least to
learn something extra in their lives, I&#8217;m happy. I don&#8217;t care if I have
a huge audience or if I&#8217;m famous. I care for the undergrad that is
starting today, the high school kid that is hacking at night, or the
Java coder that is looking for some better language (Ok, not really, but
I couldn&#8217;t resist). And this is one of the things that I learned in
Science, always give back and don&#8217;t expect anything in return. Just add
to the pile of knowledge. So, my advice for the three people that read
this site is: let Nada Surf in!</p>
