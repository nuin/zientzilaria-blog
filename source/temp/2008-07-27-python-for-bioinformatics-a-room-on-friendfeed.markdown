via [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Friendfeed.png)A
couple of days ago a [Python for Bioinformatics
room](http://friendfeed.com/rooms/python-for-bioinformatics) was created
on [FriendFeed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed "FriendFeed").
From all the Bioinformatics-related computer languages groups is the one
with the highest number of subscribers. Anyone is welcomed to join and
contribute to the room. The room has limited resources so far, but we
are hoping it grows a lot in the next few days. Come join us.
