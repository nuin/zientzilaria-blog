This website uses as a premise the book: Beginning Perl for
Bioinformatics by James Tisdal (click
[here]("http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596000804/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=genedrift-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596000804">here</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=genedrift-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596000804" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;")
to buy it). which was published in 2001. My idea here is to follow the
structure of the book, analyzing each chapter and converting the Perl
scripts into Python. The original book is very well written and an
excellent starting point for any aspiring bioinformatician, either if
you are a biologist that does not understand programming or a computer
scientist that does not know a lot of biology and maybe even Perl. In no
way this website/tutorial tries to plagiarize the book and I will try to
include a minimum amount Perl code, as the book is only used as an
starting point (a very good one indeed) to this journey into Python.
Here you will not find biological concept explanations and criticisms
towards Perl. Making this clear, I will start from the beginning. **Why
Python (and not Perl)?**
