As you might have noticed from the previous posts, comments in Python
are defined mainly by the `#` sign. This is the signal used for single
line comment like [sourcecode language='python']\#this is a single line
comment[/sourcecode] If you are used to C++, this would be equivalent to
`//`. On the other hand, multi line comments are defined by triple
double quotes `"""`, opening and closing, similar to C++ `/* ... */`,
like this [sourcecode language='python']"""this is a multi line
comment"""[/sourcecode] Just a note. Resuming bioinformatics mode.
