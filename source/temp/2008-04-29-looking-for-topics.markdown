I am preparing a couple of posts based on the latest entries and some
other subject and after that we going to check again functional
programming in Python geared to Bioinformatics. I am also planning on
covering topics on Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics and convert them to
Python. Apart from that I already have some suggestions from friends and
colleagues, but I am still looking for some subjects that the readers
would like to see covered here. Leave me a message or a comment below
with some Bioinformatics subject that would be interesting to write
about. On another note, the blog now is syndicated on Planet Python and
Unofficial Planet Python. Welcome.
