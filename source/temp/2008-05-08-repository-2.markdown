As mentioned on the last post I am moving the current repository, an
html page, to an actual Git repository on
[github.com](http://github.com). The link to the repository is
[http://github.com/nuin/beginning-python-for-bioinformatics/tree/master](http://github.com/nuin/beginning-python-for-bioinformatics/tree/master)
and it can be accessed by anyone. There are only a handful of scripts
there but I am slowly adding more comments to the scripts and moving
them to github. The web interface at github is pretty nice and the code
can be viewed on the website with a nice code highlighting, for
[example](http://github.com/nuin/beginning-python-for-bioinformatics/tree/master/scripts/code_04.py).
Also there is an RSS feed to receive updates, commits, etc. **How to
create a local copy** Git is very easy to use and it is very simple to
create a local copy of the repository on your local machine. Git is
available on most systems as a command-line utility (there is a gui but
I haven't used yet) and to have an updated copy of the Beginning Python
for Bioinformatics, two commands are needed. - first you have to `clone`
the repository **$ git clone
git://github.com/nuin/beginning-python-for-bioinformatics.git** that
will create a beginning-python-for-bioinformatics directory wherever you
run git (this only needs to be done once) and to keep the clone updated
**$ git pull** from inside the clone directory. Any questions please let
me know.
