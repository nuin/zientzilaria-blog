I have been buying Python Magazine in the last months and I really like
it, especially now that I already miss Linux Magazine and have no close
source for Linux Journal (I should subscribe, I know). Last week I got
an email from Python Magazine that I could use a coupon to buy some
issues. Coupon that I used right away. Paid with PayPal and I'm still
waiting for my issue to show up. Sent a couple of emails using the
contact form and until now, nothing. I'll wait until next year and see
what happened. It's really sad because this issue covers cloud computing
with Python. *Edit: problem solved. Thanks everyone!*
