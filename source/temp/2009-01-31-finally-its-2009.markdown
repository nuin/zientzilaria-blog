And ... we're back. The long and cold winter is still out there and
January 2009 is almost in the books. After a long period without
updating I'll try to "rush" some posts this week, trying to get back on
track. So, a little bit of what's up and coming: - a patch provided by
Robin Stocker to make all scripts published here (at least the ones on
GitHub) [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant. -
using SQLite databases in Python - developing an interface to access the
database - anything that you might suggest, just leave a comment. Let's
start 2009 then.
