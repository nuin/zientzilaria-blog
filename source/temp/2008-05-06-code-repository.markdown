I am transferring the current repository, which is "hosted" in a static
page on th blog, to a Git repository on [github.com](http://github.com).
I am posting soon a quick guide on how to access it. I am also making
all relevant entries from the blog into stand alone html pages for
off-line browsing. Anyone with Git experience the link to the repository
is
[here](http://github.com/nuin/beginning-python-for-bioinformatics/tree)
(not many commits yet, but it is coming).
