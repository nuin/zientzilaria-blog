via [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:OWWEmblem.png)The
contents of this site/blog are being (slowly) transferred to a
[wiki-like page on Open Wet
Ware](http://openwetware.org/wiki/Open_writing_projects/Beginning_Python_for_Bioinformatics).
Thanks to [Ricardo Vidal](http://my.biotechlife.net/) that started
including the articles and was the person responsible for this
initiative ([and a great artist,
illustrator](http://my.biotechlife.net/science-icons-and-logos/)).
**What is the OWW?**
[OpenWetWare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWetWare "OpenWetWare") is
an effort to promote the sharing of information, know-how, and wisdom
among researchers and groups who are working in
[biology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") & biological
engineering. Learn more about us. If you would like edit access, would
be interested in helping out, or want your lab website hosted on
OpenWetWare, please join us.
