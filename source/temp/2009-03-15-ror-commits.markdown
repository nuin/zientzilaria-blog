Just illustrating my point (or lack of), an animation about the commits
of RoR to its repository. Notice the jump after it was migrated to
Github \
[Ruby on Rails](http://vimeo.com/2979844) from [Ilya
Grigorik](http://vimeo.com/user1211508) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).
Sorry for the non-Python post.
