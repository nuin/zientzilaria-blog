The date came and is now gone, and I forgot to "celebrate" two years of
Beginning Python for Bioinformatics on December 13th. I would like to
thank everyone that commented, helped with posts and suggested anything
that would make this website better. Clearly it is far from being what I
wanted it to be, but slowly but surely we will get there. Thanks again
and I wish an excellent holiday season and a great 2009 to everyone! See
you in 2009.
