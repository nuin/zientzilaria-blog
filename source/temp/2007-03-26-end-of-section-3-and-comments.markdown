With the last post we finished Section 3 of the book. As always some
subjects were not covered, maybe because Python is different than perl
or maybe that is not suitable for an introduction to Python. From now
on, the book presents much longer scripts and I will try to follow
closely, and include some modifications and updates that I find
opportune. Regarding comments, I have been receiving a lot of spam in
the [Blind.Scientist](http://blindscientist.genedrift.org) blog so I
kept it closed here until I learned a little bit more about WordPress
administration. Please fell free to post your comments and critics and
point out errors and mistakes. Thanks.
