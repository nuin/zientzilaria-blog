A suggestion: whenever you are coding or leaning a new language it is
always opportune to have at hand some code to compare, check and learn.
One of the good tools to do code search is
[Krugle](http://www.krugle.com), where you can extensively search code
based on language, project name, among other variables. One example: I
searched for IUPAC entries on Krugle and found a lot of results, in
different computer languages and could see the projects that they were
linked to. It is a way to check if your approach is the ideal or if
there is a way to improve your code.
