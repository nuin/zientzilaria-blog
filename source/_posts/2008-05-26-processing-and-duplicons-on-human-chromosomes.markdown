Thanks to [Pawel](http://freelancingscience.com/), I got introduced to the world of [Processing](http://processing.org) and I must say I am impressed. It is a nice tool to create nice data displays. In the picture below I used a source code that Pawel sent me modified to display duplicons (larger than 30 kilobases) blast hits (larger than 5 kilobases) on a small arm of an [human chromosome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome). Of course due to the number of blast hits, different duplicons involved and the chromosome arm's length (60 Mb) the arcs and the colours are not easy to format. But still there is a good amount of information regarding hit identity and similar duplicons in different chromosomal regions.
