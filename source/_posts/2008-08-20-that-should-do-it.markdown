[![To play a note, the fret button and strum bar ...](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Guitarhero-screen.jpg/202px-Guitarhero-screen.jpg)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Guitarhero-screen.jpg)Image via [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Guitarhero-screen.jpg) Now that [BMX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMX) and trampoline are in the Olympics (OK, all right, trampoline got in a couple of editions ago) I can say that the Olympics are a [bona fide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith) international competition. I would like to thank to the enlightened people that include those wonderful "sports" in the competition. I can't wait to see [rock-paper-scissors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors) and [Guitar Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero) in 2012.
