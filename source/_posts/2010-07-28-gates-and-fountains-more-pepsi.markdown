Sometimes, I wish that the famous Watergate Hotel in my beloved Washington, DC was called Waterfountain. It would be much more difficult for the cliche-driven media to use a "fountain" suffix at the end of every scandal (just imagine the Climategate becoming the Climatefountain), but in some situations it would be great.

Think now that the [Pepsigate](http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/26/the-pepsi-challenge.html) (really? Newsweek. Slow news day?) would become, in a excellent fit, the Pepsifountain. 

More Pepsi for everyone!!
