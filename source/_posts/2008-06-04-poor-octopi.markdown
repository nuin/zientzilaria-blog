[![DETROIT - MAY 26:  Building manager, Al Sobotka flings an octopus around during a break from game two of the 2008 NHL Stanley Cup Finals between the Detroit Red Wings and the Pittsburgh Penguins at Joe Louis Arena on May 26, 2008 in Detroit, Michigan. The Red Wings defeated the Penguins 3-0 to set the series at 2-0 Red Wings.](http://cache.daylife.com/imageserve/02tu1RtgMbbc2/102x150.jpg)](http://www.daylife.com/image/02tu1RtgMbbc2)Image by [Getty Images](http://www.daylife.com/source/Getty_Images) via [Daylife](http://www.daylife.com)Detroit's [Red Wings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings) tradition says someone needs to turn/throw an octopus on the ice before the game in order to get the crowd fired-up. I've never seen any organized group, such as [PETA](http://www.peta.org), to fight against this horrendous tradition. What!, nobody care for the poor [cephalopods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod)? Imagine what would happen if the Pittsburgh Penguins decided to throw a dead penguin on the ice to get the crowd fired-up? Why a cephalopod doesn't have the same status of a bird?
