I have tried to attend BOSC 2005 in Detroit but run out funds at the time and could only be at ISMB. I missed 06 and 07 meetings, no papers, posters ready. But 2008 ISMB and [BOSC](http://news.open-bio.org/archives/2008_02.html#000093) will be in my "hometown", Toronto. If you are coming let me know we can definitely hang out.
