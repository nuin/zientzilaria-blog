AC Milan's player is [going to have arthroscopic knee surgery](http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/8169594/AC-Milan%27s-Kaka-to-have-arthroscopic-knee-surgery). That's really strange, because he is a member of the [Reborn in Christ Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igreja_Renascer_em_Cristo) (Renascer in Portuguese), and usually they perform "[cure sessions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NGpQE3bdso)" on TV to whoever send them money. C'mon Kaká you don't need those bloody doctors to cure you, just ask around.
