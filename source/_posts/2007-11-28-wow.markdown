I have been using [RepeatMasker](http://www.repeatmasker.org/) to mask common repeats of my sequences. I have just upgraded it to the version open-3.1.8 from open-3.1.6 and the speed gain was incredible. The same 10 Mb sequence that was taking more than a day to run in 3.1.6 took a couple of minutes on the newest. Nice!

_I need to correct myself: I was using version open-3.1.6, not 7_
