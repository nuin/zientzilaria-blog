Painful installation process for the latest Apple OS. Multiple failures during install, DVD trapped inside the drive, old system wiped out without warning, computer unusable for hours and hours. Installing Leopard reminded me when I first installed Windows 95 on my 40 Gb disk. I had the original 95 that couldn't handle disks larger than 4 Gb (I think)  so it was a painful process to install, install SP1, repartition the drive and then finish. Hours and hours, just like Leopard yesterday.

And it is 2008, not 1996. Worse than that only OS/2. Thanks Apple: you blasted the last atoms of apple-fanboy in me.
