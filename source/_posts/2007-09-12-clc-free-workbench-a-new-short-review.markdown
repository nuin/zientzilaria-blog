I decided to give CLC free workbench a new look, just after the last update. Apart from the change in size, at least on Windows, there is not a lot of changes on the interface, which still looks a little bit more clumsier than Geneious. 

But there was some nice changes behind the scene. I have tried version 3 again just to make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong when aligning two sequences, and I wasn't. So I decided to test aligning the same sequences on the new version 4 and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the alignment procedure runs fast and smoothly. 

I will probably post a larger review and maybe a comparison with Geneious in the near future. Stay tuned.
