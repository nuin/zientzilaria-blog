Staying on the thirsty-topic of my earlier post, I think Pepsi contributed more to Science and related fields than most of us could. I had lost all hope that corporations could be good, but I was wrong. I don't usually drink cola, but when I do I prefer (and always will) Pepsi.

After I finish my seventh cold Pepsi can of the day (it's hot here!) I might even want to check Science Blogs again.

Cheers, with Pepsi.
