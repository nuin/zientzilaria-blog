[$1,000 reward offered for stolen cancer research laptop](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/14/stolen_cancer_research_laptop_reward/):




> Medical researchers in Oklahoma are offering a no-questions-asked $1,000 reward for the return of a stolen laptop that contains years of research on prostate cancer.

Sook Shin lost the 13-inch white MacBook last Sunday after thieves smashed the window of the car she shares with husband, Ralf Jankecht, and made off with the laptop. Data on the machine was not backed up.



So, you never backup your data or have an extra copy, and, at the same time, value "years" of research just one thousand dollars. Pathetic.
