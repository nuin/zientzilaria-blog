On the latest post I forgot to mention a book that is wonderful for those with no programming habits and for those who have (in this case more like vices). 

[Code Craft: The Practice of Writing Excellent Code](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593271190?ie=UTF8&tag=genedrift-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1593271190)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=genedrift-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1593271190)

It is a very good read, with several insights on how to write programs.
