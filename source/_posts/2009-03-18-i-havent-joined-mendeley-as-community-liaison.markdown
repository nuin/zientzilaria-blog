Despite rumors floating in the upper echelons on the interwebs, I must admit that I haven't been approached, contacted, persuaded or forced to join [Mendeley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendeley) as a Community Liaison. I understand the rumours were founded on the statement from one of the company's staff member that my role in the software development is "crucial" (not his exact words, but in the ballpark).

I wish [Gunn](http://synthesis.williamgunn.org/2009/03/18/ive-joined-mendeley-as-community-liaison/) and [Vidal](http://my.biotechlife.net/2009/03/04/community-liaison-mendeley/) all the luck.
