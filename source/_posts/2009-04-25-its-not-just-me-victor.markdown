"[Mendeley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendeley) seems to be choking while importing my 1039 pdfs from ~/Documents/Papers/. Beachballing, can't tell what it is doing." [mja on Twitter](http://twitter.com/mja/status/1612595721).

And in reply:

"@mja Mendeley did exactly the same to me. Hangs on every start up now." [sjcockell on Twitter](http://twitter.com/sjcockell/status/1612725193).


So, I guess it's not something personal to the nice chaps that work at Mendeley. The software is pretty bad, and that's the only reality here. And I'm not criticizing, I'm just stating.
