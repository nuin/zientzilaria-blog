(this will be a weekly post on the most important news of the week, things that caught our eyes here at Blind.Scientist headquarters)

- Apparently there is a rich guy on the internet that likes to show off how many computers he has, but doesn't know a lot about technology and stuff. Anyway, [how not to write a post](http://calacanis.com/2009/08/08/the-case-against-apple-in-five-parts/). Never used his website.

- [Mendeley still sucks](http://friendfeed.com/jhabig/78b050c5/mendeley_com-if-i-didn-t-have-very-good). And crashes, and ...
