I thought that [EPL](http://www.soccerlounge.tv/2007/05/epl_best_in_the_world.html) [was](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqWQSOee_LQ&feature=related) [the](http://www.tv.com/english-premier-league/show/70376/reviews.html?review_id=423803&flag=) [best](http://www.sportsfilter.com/comments.cfm/4413) [league in the world](http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4986247/Americans-Vote-Barclays-English-Premier.html). Being the best, England should have the best players, thus the best national team. I was wrong. They will always have 2012 to try.

I think everything can be summarized with this article: " Americans Vote Barclays English Premier League Best Soccer League in the World". Oh, irony.
