A wonderful [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/d3uq5/pz_myers_kurzweil_still_doesnt_understand_the/c0xd6qd) on Reddit, regarding the Cult Leader re-response to Kurzweil:





> He seems almost proud of his own narcissism. As if people were just waiting with bated breath for him to grace his audience with another tit-for-tat in this petty feud. Oh what an inconvenience it is for him to have to update his own douchey blog.

I can't tell who is worse: PZM or the people who look to him for what they should think about any issue.



Thank you, thank you. Whoever you are.
