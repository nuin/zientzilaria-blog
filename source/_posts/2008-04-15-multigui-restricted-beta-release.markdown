We are releasing multiGUI (Windows Vista and XP) as a limited beta. If you are interested in trying the software send an email to multigui at genedrift dot org. We are intending to provide a group of 20-30 users the opportunity to try the program, what would allow us to work on future improvements, kill some bugs that weren't found in the development/test phase and check for the level of interest of our application in the scientific community.
