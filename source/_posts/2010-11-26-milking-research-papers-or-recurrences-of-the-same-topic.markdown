Milking research papers is not the field of research of milk and derivatives; it's just the ever increasing number of papers from the same group of authors that are basically the same thing, with different clothes. I'm talking only about Bioinformatics, but I don't doubt that it can be found anywhere.

It used to be create the software, publish the paper, and if you don't forget about it, create a new version and publish again. Wash, rinse, repeat. I'm guilty of that, with WinPop, but versions were light-years apart from each other. Now the tendency is to publish the software, publish the method, then the new method, new version(s), web version, portable version. Wash, Rinse, Lathe, Rinse, Wash, Repeat.

I hope we can invent some other media to run scientific software, maybe some day I will be publishing a Google TV version of some alignment software. Maybe.
