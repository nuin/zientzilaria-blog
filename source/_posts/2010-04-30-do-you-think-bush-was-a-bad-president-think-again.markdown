This week in a public speech the individual that acts as Brazilian president uttered the following gem (loosely translated by me):



> We are the result of a triple mixture, I mean, a genetics purified in three continents that resulted in our people. I don't know if there's another people (nation) like us, but there's nothing better, nothing more pure than us




For those who think living under Bush (and Harper to some extent) was cruel, I don't want to imagine what is to live being governed by this idiot.
