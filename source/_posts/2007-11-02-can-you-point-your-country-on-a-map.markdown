This week the largest Brazilian magazine (Newsweek-, Time-style) has a [report](http://veja.abril.uol.com.br/071107/p_108.shtml) (closed source, in Portuguese) about the percentage of Brazilians that can find Brazil on a World Map. The report's title can be freely translated to "And we mock the Americans ...", referencing the usual stories of the ignorance of the Americans and other nationalities on geographical knowledge. At least 1000 people were interviewed in different Brazilian state capitals and 50% were not able to point the country on a map and, not surprisingly, only 18% can find US.
