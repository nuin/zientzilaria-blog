So, Watson [said](http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/18/europe/EU-GEN-Britain-US-Scientist-Racism.php) what he said and then got some lectures [canceled](http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/10/18/science-watson-controversy.html). Fine.

Now Cold Spring Harbor issued an [statement](http://www.cshl.edu/public/releases/07_statement.html) basically distancing themselves from Watson and his comments. I fail to understand one thing: when he says good things, he is the Chancellor of CSHL and when they don't like the comment, he is not "speaking on behalf of the institution".
