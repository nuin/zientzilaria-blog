Some points:

1- He was and still is vilified, not because we (the public) think he is a villain, but his actions made him one (in the public's eye). As a scientist, I understand the process and understand what he might be going through, what takes us to the next point ...

2- Open your data, let it be scrutinized, dissected, explored. I'm not the greatest supporter of Open Science/Research, but if you're feeling this way, open up, show the methods, don't go crawling into a cocoon with you fellow vil ... climate scientists. I don't trust bloggers too (including myself) but I have seen some wonderful science or science related material in blogs and by bloggers. Send us the data and we will publish some peer reviewed climate research. Want to bet?

3- You can only abstract from the concluding phrase the fact that climate researchers need is more support (go figure!) and maybe to become a tighter group. Summarizing, they need more money.
