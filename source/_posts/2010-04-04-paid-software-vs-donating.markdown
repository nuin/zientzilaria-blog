No, I don't pirate them either. But whenever I buy something I get highly disappointed. Recently I bought [TuneUp](http://www.tuneupmedia.com/blog/), which is a iTunes plugin for Macs. It seems to work great, most of the time at least, bu every time I add one song to the library, it tries to re-sync with it, and it usually takes hours and hours. Really frustrating. 

That's why is better to stick to free stuff and donate when you feel like doing it. Sometimes it's better.
