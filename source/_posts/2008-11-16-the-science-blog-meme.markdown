It started [here](http://network.nature.com/groups/nnbloggername/forum/topics/3392) and I got it from [here](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/11/the_science_blog_meme.php). Here are my responses:

**1. What is your blog about?**

Anything that I wish I had done and willing to do. Also there are interviews (I want to do more!).

**2. What will you never write about?**

Confidential stuff, anything that is very personal or people do not want to publicize. Send me a message if you want to know the latest gossip in Bioinformatics.

**3. Have you ever considered leaving science?**

Nope, but sometimes I have the feeling that I would like to be a airplane pilot.

**4. What would you do instead?**

Airplane pilot? F1 mechanic? 

**5. What do you think will science blogging be like in 5 years?**

Oh boy, I dunno. Ask me in five years, if I'm still around.

**6. What is the most extraordinary thing that happened to you because of blogging?**

Extraordinary? Nothing. If you call extraordinary befriending someone, than I can say that is. Being able to feel part of a community, that's a good one.

**7. Did you write a blog post or comment you later regretted?**

Nope.

**8. When did you first learn about science blogging?**

Nodalpoint was the catalyst. I knew about blogging for quite sometime, but Maddox influenced me not to, until I found out Nodalpoint.

**9. What do your colleagues at work say about your blogging?**

"What blog?"

**10. Extra credit: are you able to write an entry to your blog that takes the form of a poem about your research?**

Yes. If you want to read it, leave a comment. If I get 20 comments, I will post it.
