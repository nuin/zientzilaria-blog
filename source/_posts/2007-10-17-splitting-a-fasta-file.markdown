I have posted in my other [site](http://python.genedrift.org) different ways to split a FASTA file. [Take a look](http://python.genedrift.org/2007/10/10/alternative-methods-to-split-a-fasta-file/). The Python method is [here](http://python.genedrift.org/2007/10/10/splitting-multiple-fasta-file-or-why-shouldnt-we-reinvent-the-wheel/).

I am planning to include as many languages as possible.
