Champions League final gets to penalty shots. If the old [Corinthian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_F.C.) was part of this match the result would be already defined.

From the ESPN live commentary:



> How fitting perhaps that the Champions League final between two English sides should end in a pathetic bout of chest-bumping and disrespect. It's been a big issue all year in England and now it's two best sides have betrayed the Premier League with their self-indulgent griping and petulance. Crazy.
