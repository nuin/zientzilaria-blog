Leaving the Science behind, and thanks to the "beauty" of open office spaces fro bioinformatics development, I am able to enjoy three great music masterpieces (AKA the records I would take to an isolated island)

1- [Black Love - Afghan Whighs](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Love-Afghan-Whigs/dp/B000002HLG/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1203019110&sr=8-1)

2- [Heaven up Here - Echo and the Bunnymen](http://www.amazon.com/Heaven-Up-Here-Echo-Bunnymen/dp/B0000E2Y8Z/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1203019254&sr=1-2)

3- [Starfish - The Church](http://www.amazon.com/Starfish-Church/dp/B0009NR7VI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1203019320&sr=1-1)
