I'm reading the second book on Feynman, [What Do You Care What Other People Think?: Further Adventures of a Curious Character](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393320928?ie=UTF8&tag=genedrift-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393320928)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=genedrift-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0393320928) and the only thing I can he was an incredible person, one that any one can admire. I have no idols, I don't worship anyone, but Feynman gets the closest possible to being one for me.
