It's really strange to read so many negative stories about the iPad, why it will fail, why it sucks, etc, etc. So many bytes wasted (including these here) to cover something that nobody used yet, no one has ever seen, nor was actually released. So many bytes wasted on stories about something that, if you don't like and think Apple and Steve Jobs are trying to control their users/customers, you have full control of: like it, buy it, don't, don't buy it.

So many stories about how closed source computer, software is being forced upon fearful customers. While we worry about that, in the US, companies, corporations are now persons.
