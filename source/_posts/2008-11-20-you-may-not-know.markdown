I rarely write about myself around here (or anywhere else), so once in a while it's good to do so. The extra-credit part of the Scientific Blog Meme, asked if one was able to write about his/her research. Well, mine was posted yesterday.

You may not know, but when I was really young I always wanted to be a book writer, and when I was 16, 17, I started writing (bad) poetry, but ended up never developing it, after life threw some bad things at me.

Thanks a lot for the 25 brave souls that read it.
