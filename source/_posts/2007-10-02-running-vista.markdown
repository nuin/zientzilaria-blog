Recently I purchased a new system. It is a "slimline" HP computer that comes pre-loaded with Windows Vista Home whatever. My first idea was to partition the drive and install XP and a Linux distribution. While I was organizing my files, transferring stuff from my old box to the new one I got used to Vista. It is not a flawless system, like any other, it has its share of problems but has some nice things too.

On the upside, it is nice to the eyes. It is a beautiful desktop system, with some eye candy displays and some nice features, that are an upgrade over XP. The interface is cleaner and the Start button- Programs button-bar is much more functional. Not to mention the search which is vastly improved over its predecessor.

On the downside, there still some obstacles to pass. This system comes equipped with WiFi Internet and I decided to use only that due to the amount of cables needed. Even though the router is just inches from the mini-tower I stayed with wireless. For a couple of days it was fine, then Vista lost it and cannot find the wireless card. Gone, kaput. It happened to me once with XP: the system refused to enable the on-board ethernet card, which was working perfectly under Linux.

Accomplishing simple things on Vista are very annoying. To run applications and setup packages you are greeted with dialogs asking if you really want to run the program or not. Even Microsoft applications are not spared of the pre-check. Sharing folder on a intranet is a breeze, but not if you have a Mac on the side. My version of Vista does not come with some Administrator tools, which are only available on the top version (extra 200 bucks) and some user security settings can only be set via registry. It took me more than minutes to find a solution online that allowed me to connect from Vista to my iMac. 

I think I am keeping Vista for a while. At least it saves me some disk space, not having to install XP too. Let's see how it goes.
