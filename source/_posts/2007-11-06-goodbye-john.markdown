I discovered John Rebus in 2002, on a trip to Canada. It was almost winter and a cool place to hang with my wife was the Eaton Centre and the Chapters (or Indigo) inside it. There I discovered [The Falls](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFalls-Ian-Rankin%2Fdp%2F0752877259%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1194375773%26sr%3D8-3&tag=genedrift-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=genedrift-20&l=ur2&o=1) there, attracted by the stylish cover and for the good reviews on the back. I decided to give it a try and after that I was hooked. Read all the other books by [Ian Rankin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=ian%20rankin&tag=genedrift-20&index=blended&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=genedrift-20&l=ur2&o=1).

Sadly he decided to retire John Rebus in his latest book. I will miss Edinburgh (for a while maybe) and I will miss John and Siobham. Thanks for the ride, it was fun.
