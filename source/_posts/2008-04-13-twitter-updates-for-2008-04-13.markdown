  * @[neilfws](http://twitter.com/neilfws) I am counting on that ... fingers crossed [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788494339)

	
  * @[zzgavin](http://twitter.com/zzgavin) apparently ... [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788432971)

	
  * @[freesci](http://twitter.com/freesci) It was strange. I installed fine on my iMac. On Vista the installation fails. I still don't have an account. [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788397837)

	
  * @[yokofakun](http://twitter.com/yokofakun) Yep, I have that, but no expert so far. In VS I sually program VB and VC++. I am trying to get C# and IronPython [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788388717)

	
  * @[mndoci](http://twitter.com/mndoci) I should to that, but I am addicted to Visual Studio ... we all have our bad vices ... [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788387341)

	
  * @[freesci](http://twitter.com/freesci) Do you have your account? [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788385623)

	
  * @[freesci](http://twitter.com/freesci) I even installed ActiveState Python to check. Python 2.5.2 is in the path and everything else finds it. [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788384958)

	
  * @[freesci](http://twitter.com/freesci) I tried to install on my Vista machine and it keeps complaining about the "lack" of Python. [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788384707)

	
  * @[mndoci](http://twitter.com/mndoci) time is the key word here [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788330648)

	
  * @[mndoci](http://twitter.com/mndoci) I have been to Uruguay and to the border of Bolivia, but Buenos Aires may be too good to miss. [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788314605)

	
  * @[mndoci](http://twitter.com/mndoci) 29 years of Brazil is enough for me. Now only for quick visits. But I would love to go to Peru, Argentina and Chile. [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788312175)

	
  * Will the Orange and Black have a better fate today? [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788311759)

	
  * @[neilfws](http://twitter.com/neilfws) South America is good for a brief period and just for tourism. Apart from that ... The flora and fauna are great anyway. [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788116199)

	
  * Gave up AppEngine on Windows ... frustrating ... [#](http://twitter.com/nuin/statuses/788082599)
