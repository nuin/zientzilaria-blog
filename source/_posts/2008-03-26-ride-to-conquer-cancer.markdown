My supervisor, Elisabeth Tillier, is part of a team on the Ride to Conquer Cancer benefiting the Princess Margaret Hospita, Toronto, Canada. The ride is a beautiful event where people ride their bikes from Toronto to Niagara Falls, during two days in June.

If you want to donate there is an easy way by going to [Elisabeth's page on the ride website](http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Events/Toronto2008?px=1548939&pg=personal&fr_id=1201&et=E-PMVS5Y4td-3Bf4EqAgug..&s_tafId=96521). She is riding for her sister in law Carine, which was diagnosed an year ago with breast cancer, just after giving birth to her second son. Every little counts.
