There's always the right time for everything. And for some scientific software it's time for retirement. I will give here a one examples, but I bet if you're a bioinformatician you will have others, and if you're something else you will scratch your head and think "This guy is right!". So let's see the case of **[ClustalW](http://www.clustal.org)**.

ClustalW was the first massively used alignment program and it's a great program. But in my opinion it was a great program and has to be remembered as such, a great tool that introduced the mysteries of sequence alignment to so many people. It had everything, an UI, a command line, and more important it converted and many file formats.

A quick search on Google Scholar shows about 45000 results for ClustalW, but I'm sorry, it has to go. You have to stop using it, please. If you're a bioinformatician, stop supporting it, don't create a ClustalW(X) wrapper on any tool, forget about it. Every time someone mentions the word Clustal in front of you, pretend that he/she is a creationist. If you are not a bioinformatician, ask your local bioinformatician what is the best tool to use (Muscle, [MAFFT](http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/software/) and [ProbCons](http://probcons.stanford.edu/) are my favourite), delete the ClustalW on your HD (save one for posterity) and start living the high-alignment-life.
