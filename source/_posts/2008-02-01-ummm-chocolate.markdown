Apparently is not only in bioinformatics that you can publish Greasemonkey scripts, Excel macros and 40* errors on PubMed entries.

BMJ also has some [very useful science](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/335/7633/1287?fmr) and with its impact factor higher than 9, I can see a lot of opportunity to publish there. I guess just this short article alone would be able to "provide a rare opportunity for the chocolate industry to become **palpably** involved in public health promotion".
