Welcome to the new home of Beginning Python for Bioinformatics and Blind.Scientist: Zientzilaria, scientist in Basque. Most posts of the old blogs are converted here, now in an Octopress installation. Slowly, I will start fixing the small mistakes of the Wordpress migration and getting everything up to speed.

In this new home I will try to be more optimistic, bring more news and criticize less. Cheers to a new beginning. 

PS: The new blog motto is "The most influential bioinformatician in the world", tongue-in-cheek of course.
