I was invited by Packt Publishing to review **[Python Testing Beginner's
Guide](http://www.packtpub.com/python-testing-beginners-guide/book/mid/240210aaphjg)**
by Daniel Arbuckle. This is a book on one of the most important aspects
of scientific programming (even though the majority of scientific
software don't have any testing routines): code testing, checking if
your code actually does what is intended to do. I can say I'm not really
an expert on testing so I guess I'm the right audience for it:

> You'll learn about several of Python's automated testing tools, and
> you'll learn about the philosophies and methodologies that they were
> designed to support, like unit testing and test-driven development.
> When you're done, you'll be able to produce thoroughly tested code
> faster and more easily than ever before, and you'll be able to do it
> in a way that doesn't distract you from your "real" programming.

Packt also supplied a preview/sample chapter that you can download
[here](http://python.genedrift.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/8846-python-testing-beginners-guide-sample-chapter-5-when-doctest-isnt-enough-unittest-to-the-rescue.pdf).
I hope to get a review ready by the end of the week. before the Ontario
Institute of Cancer Research retreat, otherwise I will try to post a
full review next week.
