Indeed I'm excited for [PLoS blogs](http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2010/09/announcing-plos-blogs/): they don't have a cult leader (yet?!), the lineup is good and well balanced and they posts are good (so far).

I just hope it doesn't become the first blog community where reading is free but you have to pay to publish your comment. After all they will be spending a lot of money of server time and bandwidth.
