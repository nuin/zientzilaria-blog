I applaud anyone that stands against the cult-leader and tabloid-like science: [Ray Kurzweil Responds to "Ray Kurzweil does not understand the brain"](http://www.kurzweilai.net/ray-kurzweil-responds-to-ray-kurzweil-does-not-understand-the-brain). Still, unfortunately, the cult is so brainwashed, just like a far-right-Sarah-Palin-lover Republican or a far-left-Chavez-is-THE-answer Democrat that this will be just more amusement to the cyber-hooligans that levitate around the Church.

More Pepsi, please.
