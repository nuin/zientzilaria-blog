I think it's pretty clear now that Google Wave is the biggest failure of the beta international hype machine. Such a bloated useless application. It's been so long since I logged on it and I don't have any wave updated (even the ones that should be welcoming different users). Lame.


_PS: Thinking, Wave is the second place of the hype machine failures. Clearly Mendeley is first. _
