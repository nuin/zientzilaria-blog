Just an update to my previous post: I submitted around 40 sequences to NCBI, all of them from South American frogs and toads. You can find all of them [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=nucleotide&cmd=&term=nuin+[AUTH]&go=Go). If you ever use them, I'd be happy to know and we can even share a beer sometime.
