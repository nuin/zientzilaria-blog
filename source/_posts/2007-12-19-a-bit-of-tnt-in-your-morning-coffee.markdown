[TNT](http://www.zmuc.dk/public/phylogeny/tnt/) is free!!! Long live TNT.

TNT stands for Tree analysis using New Technology. First published in 1999 by Nixon and Goloboff on Cladistics (where else?) it gives you the possibility doing phylogenetic analysis using parsimony and ... No, that's it. Only parsimony. But there is a bright side: you can actually run it on Linux and Mac, albeit without a user interface. That's a major step for a program that when first released had an icon depicting an apple with the forbidden sign around it. 

I am planning to test it and post a review soon.
