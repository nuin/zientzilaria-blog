Some irrelevant impressions about the World Cup in South Africa:

- vuvuzela will probably be the only thing that you will remember about this cup. And that's sad.

- mediocre players so far (with few exceptions), mediocre ball

- According to CBC (Canada) Australia is (was) one the coming powers in football. I guess they need to hire some real analysts, or let me comment hockey

- Apart from Messi and Germany, nothing good so far. And the English goalkeeper too, classic. It's becoming a norm to make fun of the poor Englishmen every four years. 

- Also according to Canadian TV, Italy is not known for slow starts. They don't have tapes from the matches since 1982. Again, better analysts.
