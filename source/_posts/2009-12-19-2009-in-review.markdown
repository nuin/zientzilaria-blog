Here's the best and worst of 2009:

- Movie: Rocknrolla, not the best one, but highly entertaining, worst: Funny People
- Book: [Born Standing Up: A Comic's Life](http://www.amazon.com/Born-Standing-Up-Comics-Thorndike/dp/1410403122%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1410403122) by Steve Martin, highly entertaining too
- Website: The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs, worst: of the ones I usually read is the [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/)
- Software: Textmate, worst [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com), by 1000 miles
- TV: [Stephen Colbert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert) and Jon Stewart, the best hour of TV, worst: Dexter's finale
- Purchase: MacBook 13'', the best computer I ever had
- Money-grabbing-scheme: Global Warming or Climate Change
- Politician: no best in the category, but the worst is the Brazilian President.
- Music: I didn't have a favourite this year. but Matthew Good's Vancouver is growing on me. No worst, or too many to care about
