I can count in one hand how many times I've ever been in a ultra organized scientific lab. In some of them I don't know how people work and are able to publish results obtained in the lab. Because of that and inspired by the countless _reality_ TV shows, I decided to start pitching the idea of the **Laboratory Walkover**.

We will come to your lab with a TV crew, a interior designer and a high level authority in your field of research and we are going to stop to nothing to make your lab the best research space on earth. You won't need to pay a dime for the makeover/walkover/takeover, on the contrary we will give you $5000 for consumables and a new PCR machine (if applicable).

I'm already looking for sponsors and channels, and if you want your lab o qualify for the walkover, send me a picture.
