From this [post](http://wrightfisher.wordpress.com/2008/01/25/20/) I became aware of the paper "Alignment Uncertainty and Genomic Analysis" by Wong _et al._.

We learn valuable lessons, some evident and some implied. I am covering only the evident here, the implied I leave for the imagination of who's reading the paper. To the evident lessons (conclusions):




	
  * Alignments are important for genomics studies

	
  * Some genes are more difficult to align than others

	
  * Some alignment programs align some genes better than others, while other alignment programs align other genes better than some

	
  * Most genes in an organism are under the same DNA model of substitution, hence they all have identical selective pressure, drift, migration, recombination and mutation rates



There are things you can only learn from Science.
