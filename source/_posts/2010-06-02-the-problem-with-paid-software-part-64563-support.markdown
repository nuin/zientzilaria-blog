About a year ago I purchased [Zennaware](http://www.zennaware.com/)'s Cornerstone, a SVN client for Macs. It's a nice application, works really well, it does what it is supposed to do, But as any software is has bugs and problems, and after paying around 50 bucks for a license, one expects that at least one email asking how perform one thing with the software would be answered. It has been more than three weeks that I sent an email to their support team in order to know how to delete some failed repositories from a list, still nothing.

Sometimes, I don't know why I pay for software.
