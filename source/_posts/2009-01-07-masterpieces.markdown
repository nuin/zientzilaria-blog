In my humble opinion (of sorts!) every band, musical group, singer, bad or good, mediocre or excellent have, in one way or another, produced at least one masterpiece (yes, I like commas). This song can be extremely good or just ordinary. If it's extremely good it surpasses or rivals other compositions of identical level, if it's ordinary, it might be the one and only good (in terms) song that that group created. I have more than 800 CDs, 150 Lps and thousands of music recorded or bought online, and here is my list of masterpieces, so far and in no particular order.
