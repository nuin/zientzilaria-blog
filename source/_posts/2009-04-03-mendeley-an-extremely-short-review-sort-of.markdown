I decided to test [Mendeley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendeley) again (Yes, I have some kind of a masochist behaviour for software), and as the [last time I tried](http://blindscientist.genedrift.org/2008/08/25/mendeley-a-very-short-review/), I can say I'm not impressed. 

I tested on a directory containing mixed bag of PDFs, books, book chapters, articles and misc stuff. Most of the time the data was extracted but I ended with a wrong reference or garbage information about the file. Not mentoning that it took almost one full hour to analyse a little bit more than 500 files. I think I need to buy an eight-core machine now. The CPU peaked at 25-30% (one full core for it) on Vista, and the memory got up to 300 Mbs.

Not impressed, maybe one day.
