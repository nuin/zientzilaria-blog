I tried to become a Mendeley University Advisor, whatever it is. It's the old saying "I'm in the System to destroy it from within". Understandably, I didn't get the gig. But what surprised me is the _personal_ touch in the their message:





> Thank you for your interest in becoming a Mendeley University Advisor! 

We have now received hundreds of applications from around the globe representing a wide range of academic disciplines. The sheer amount of applicants has been overwhelming and we’re currently filled to capacity. Over the next few months, we will further expand the Advisor program, at which point we would love to have you join us! You don’t need to do anything to follow up, we’ve added you to the waitlist and will be in touch as space becomes available. Thanks again for your interest and please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or comments.



So, I guess Mendeley, apart from huge PR campaign, acts like they're a huge company when they need to send automatic emails to the thousands of applicants to this desirable position. But, yet they forget to add the sucker's name to the email.

I think I will have a Pepsi.
