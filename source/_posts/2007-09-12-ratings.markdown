A new feature has been add to the blog: ratings. As I don't receive many comments on the posts but there is a steady stream of viewers of the website, I decided to add the possibility of rating a post. So, if you feel the post was useful for you, well or badly written, just click the rate you feel the post deserves. It is an Ajax-like feature so there is no reloads or any other intrusion on your normal browsing.
