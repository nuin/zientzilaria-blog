I have two Google Wave invites to go. If you want one send me an email (paulo.nuin on Gmail) or leave a comment here. The best "offer" takes it.

Offer means anything: a poem, a sticker, another invite to another service, a scientific collaboration, anything. Be creative and you will have it.

_Update: I will send both invites later tonight, Canada's ET. Google says it might take a while for the invite to reach the recipient. Some people are selling invites on Ebay, some for 100 dollars. Again the best "offer" wins. And remember, I'm not checking Twitter or Friendfeed._
