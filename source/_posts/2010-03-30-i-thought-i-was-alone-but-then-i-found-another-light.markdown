"Mendeley sucks" ® is a common search that points to this humble site. I thought I was alone and my feeling was unique, or at least I was the lone voice in the crowd ... But, then, someone, somewhere, some time searched "Mendeley sucks" ® on Google and I clicked on it and I found [this](http://scripts.mit.edu/~birge/blog/mendeley-how-not-to-run-a-beta-preview-program/). This is a MIT website, so it must be good, right?

But remember, you heard here first. "Mendeley sucks" ®
