Although I was born in Brazil, my heart (football and everything else) was always Spanish. I saw and suffer with losses to Yugoslavia, France, Italy, Belgium, Korea (what a robbery!!), etc, but today was a day of enjoyment and “good” suffering in the final minutes. Thanks to the Niño and to a wonderful 11 we leave the underachievers banner behind and hope to even better days ahead. See you in South Africa.

Aupa España!
