Just sayin'. With all the negative reviews, ponderations, blog posts, newspaper reports, I just wanted to give so kudos to Steve and the Apple family. Is it the best product ever? No. Is it the next coming of Jesus Christ? No. So what is it? It's just another product, and you, only you (maybe with your wife/husband/partner/household) will decide if it fits your budget, if it is useful for you and if you actually need to buy it. Apart from that, rants are always good for the people that writes them (I know it firsthand).

The icing on the cake is when I overheard two homeless guys discussing if you could multitask on an iPad. When they discovered you couldn't, they decided not to buy it. Last time I saw them they were in the public library computers.
