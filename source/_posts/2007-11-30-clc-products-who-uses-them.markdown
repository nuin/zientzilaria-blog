I have a Google alerts with bioinformatics as its key word and this morning I received an email that points to [this](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/90228.php) article on Medical News today. I know it has a huge amount to PR in the article, but the first phrase is symbolic:

_"CLC bio, the world's leading bioinformatics solution provider, announced the release of CLC Bioinformatics Database."_

So, I need to ask: have you ever used a CLC product or know someone that uses it? Leave a comment if so, because I never met someone that uses their products, and they are still the "world's leading bioinformatics solution provider".
