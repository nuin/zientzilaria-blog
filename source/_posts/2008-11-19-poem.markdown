One pixel
That's all I needed
Give one more line
Tree sides, and one parabola

Doesn't matter how big
the A or a are
that's just a point
for Hardy and Weinberg

One stream
where the frog sings
strangely like a bird
Sit and humid, daytime

I sat and waited, got you
Now rush, run and show me
A sequence of colours that
might mean something

Oh, I know I put them
on a tree, made by bits
and pixels like
the first one

Like the next one,
and the next, that
might be like the previous
or the last one on this 
line.
